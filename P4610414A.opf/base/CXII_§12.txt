"’Furthermore, noble son, the Dharma-worship consists of determining the Dharma according to
the Dharma;applying the Dharma according to the Dharma;being in harmony with relativity;being
free of extremist convictions;attaining the tolerance of ultimate birthlessness and nonoccurrence
of all things;realizing selflessness and living-beinglessness;refraining from
struggle about causes and conditions,without quarreling, or disputing; not being possessive;
being free of egoism;relying on the meaning and not on the literal expression;relying
on gnosis and not on consciousness;relying on the ultimate teachings definitive in meaning
and not insisting on the superficial teachings interpretable in meaning;relying on reality
and not insisting on opinions derived from personal authorities;realizing correctly the
reality of the Buddha;realizing the ultimate absence of any fundamental consciousness; and
overcoming the habit of clinging to an ultimate ground.Finally, attaining peace by stopping
everything from ignorance to old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, anxiety, and
trouble,(and realizing that living beings know no end to their views) concerning these twelve
links of dependent origination;and realizing that living beings know no end to their views
(concerning these twelve links of dependent origination;)then, noble son, when you do
not hold to any view at all, it is called the unexcelled Dharma-worship.’
