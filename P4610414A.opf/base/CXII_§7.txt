The Buddha then further said to Śakra, the prince of gods, "Once, prince of gods, long ago,
long before aeons more numerous than the innumerable, immense, immeasurable, inconceivable,
and even before then,the Tathāgata called Bhaiṣajyarāja appeared in the world: a saint,
perfectly and fully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, a blissful one, knower
of the world, incomparable knower of men who need to be civilized, teacher of gods and men,
a Lord, a Buddha. He appeared in the aeon called Vicarana in the universe called Mahavyuha."The
length of life of this Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja, perfectly and fully enlightened
one, was twenty short aeons.His retinue of disciples numbered thirty-six million billion,and
his retinue of bodhisattvas numbered twelve million billion.In that same era, prince of
gods, there was a universal monarch called King Ratnacchattra,who reigned over the four continents
and possessed seven precious jewels.He had one thousand heroic sons, powerful, strong,
and able to conquer enemy armies.
