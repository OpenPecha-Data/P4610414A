Mañjuśrī asked, "Noble sir, how should a sick bodhisattva control his own mind?"

Vimalakīrti replied, "Mañjuśrī, a sick bodhisattva should control his own mind with the following
consideration:Sickness arises from total involvement in the process of misunderstanding
from beginningless time. It arises from the passions that result from unreal mental constructions,and
hence ultimately nothing is perceived which can be said to be sick.Why?The
body is the issue of the four main elements, and in these elements there is no owner and
no agent.There is no self in this body,and except for arbitrary insistence on self, ultimately
no "I" which can be said to be sick can be apprehended.Therefore, thinking "I" should
not adhere to any self, and "I" should rest in the knowledge of the root of illness,’he should
abandon the conception of himself as a personality and produce the conception of himself
as a thing,’This body is an aggregate of many things;when it is born, only things are
born;when it ceases, only things cease;these things have no awareness or feeling of each
other;when they are born, they do not think, "I am born."When they cease, they do not think,
"I cease."’ "
