Mañjuśrī then asked further, "Noble sir, if a bodhisattva considers all living beings in such
a way,how does he generate the great love toward them?"

Vimalakīrti replied, "Mañjuśrī, when a bodhisattva considers all living beings in this way,he
thinks: ’Just as I have realized the Dharma, so should I teach it to living beings.’Thereby,
he generates the love that is truly a refuge for all living beings;the love that is peaceful
because free of grasping;the love that is not feverish, because free of passions;the
love that accords with reality because it is equanimous in all three times;the love that
is without conflict because free of the violence of the passions;the love that is nondual
because it is involved neither with the external nor with the internal;the love that is
imperturbable because totally ultimate."Thereby he generates the love that is firm, its high
resolve unbreakable, like a diamond;the love that is pure, purified in its intrinsic nature;the
love that is even, its aspirations being equal;the saint’s love that has eliminated
its enemy;the bodhisattva’s love that continuously develops living beings;The Tathāgata’s
love that understands reality;the Buddha’s love that causes living beings to awaken from
their sleep;the love that is spontaneous because it is fully enlightened spontaneously;the
love that is enlightenment because it is unity of experience;the love that has no presumption
because it has eliminated attachment and aversion;the love that is great compassion
because it infuses the Mahāyāna with radiance;the love that is never exhausted because it
acknowledges voidness and selflessness;the love that is giving because it bestows the gift
of Dharma free of the tight fist of a bad teacher;the love that is morality because it improves
immoral living beings;the love that is tolerance because it protects both self and
others;the love that is effort because it takes responsibility for all living beings;the
love that is contemplation because it refrains from indulgence in tastes;the love that is
wisdom because it causes attainment at the proper time;the love that is liberative technique
because it shows the way everywhere;the love that is without formality because it is pure
in motivation;the love that is without deviation because it acts from decisive motivation;the
love that is high resolve because it is without passions;the love that is without deceit
because it is not artificial;the love that is happiness because it introduces living
beings to the happiness of the Buddha.Such, Mañjuśrī, is the great love of a bodhisattva."
