Then the Brahmā Śikhin said to the Śāriputra the Elder:Honourable Śāriputra, do not say that
the Buddhakṣetra of the Tathāgata is impure; the Buddhakṣetra of the Blessed One is pure.Brahmā
Śikhin replied: On my part, Honourable Śāriputra, I can see that the splendour of the
Buddhakṣetra of the Blessed Lord Śākyamuni equals the splendours of the dwellings of the
Paranirmitavaśavartin gods.

The Śāriputra the Elder said to Brahmā Śikhin:On my part, O Brahmā, I can see this great land
withy rises and dips, woth thorns, precipices, peaks, and chasms, and all filled with filth.

If you see the Buddhakṣetra being so impure, it is because there are rises and dips in your
mind, O Honourable Śāriputra, and because you have certainly not purified your intentions
in the knowledge of the Buddha. On the contrary, those who possess sameness of mind regarding
all beings and who have purified their intentions in the knowledge of the Buddha can see
the Buddhakṣetra as being perfectly pure.
