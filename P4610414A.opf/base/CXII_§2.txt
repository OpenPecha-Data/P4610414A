Lord, those living beings who, having heard this teaching of the Dharma, accept it, remember
it, read it, and understand it deeply will be, without a doubt, true vessels of the Dharma;there
is no need to mention those who apply themselves to the yoga of meditation upon it.They
will cut off all possibility of unhappy lives,will open their way to all fortunate lives,will
always be looked after by all Buddhas,will always overcome all adversaries,and will
always conquer all devils.They will practice the path of the bodhisattvas,will take their
places upon the seat of Enlightenment,and will have truly entered the domain of the TathƒÅgatas.
