â€™Noble son, the seat of enlightenment is the seat of positive thought because it is without
artificiality.It is the seat of effort, because it releases energetic activities.It is the
seat of high resolve, because its insight is superior.It is the seat of the great spirit
of enlightenment, because it does not neglect anything.
