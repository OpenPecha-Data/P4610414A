Ānanda!There are buddha-fields that accomplish the buddha-work by means of bodhisattvas;those
that do so by means of lights;those that do so by means of the tree of enlightenment;those
that do so by means of the physical beauty and the marks of the Tathāgata;those that do
so by means of religious robes; those that do so by means of good; those that do so by means
of water; those that do so by means of gardens; those that do so by means of palaces;
those that do so by means of mansions;those that do so by means of magical incarnations;those
that do so by means of empty space;and those that do so by means of lights in the sky.Why
is it so, Ānanda?Because by these various means, living beings become disciplined.
