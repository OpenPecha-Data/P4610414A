The bodhisattva Pramati declared,"’Eye’ and ’form’ are dualistic.To understand the eye correctly,
and not to have attachment, aversion, or confusion with regard to form -that is called
’peace.’Similarly, ’ear’ and ’sound,’ ’nose’ and ’smell,’ ’tongue’ and taste,’ ’body’ and
touch,’ and ’mind’ and ’phenomena’ - all are dualistic.But to know the mind, and to be
neither attached, averse, nor confused with regard to phenomena -that is called ’peace.’To
live in such peace is to enter into nonduality."
