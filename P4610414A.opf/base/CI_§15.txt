If the mind of a Bodhisattva must be ppure in order for his Buddhakṣetra to be purified, then,
when the Blessed Lord Śakyamuni exercised the practices as a Bodhisattva, his mind must
have been impure, since today his Buddhakṣetra appears to be so impure.

The Blessed One, knowing the Venherable Śāriputra’s thought in his mind, said to him:What do
you think of this, Śāriputra? Is it beacuse the sun and the moon are impure that those who
are born blind cannot see them?

Śāriputra replied: Not so, Blessed One; it is the fault of those born blind, is is not the fault
of the sun and the moon.

The Buddha continued: Similarly Śāriputra, if beings cannot see the virtues of the Buddhakṣetra
of the Tathāgata, the fault is in their ignorance; the fault is not the Tathāgata’s. Śāriputra,
my Buddhakṣetra is pure, but you cannot yourself see it.
