Reverend Śāriputra, the Dharma is free of compounded things and uncompounded things.He who adheres
to compounded things and uncompounded things is not interested in the Dharma but is
interested in adhering to compounded things and uncompounded things."Thereupon, reverend
Śāriputra, if you are interested in the Dharma, you should take no interest in anything."When
Vimalakīrti had spoken this discourse, five hundred gods obtained the purity of the Dharma-eye
in viewing all things.
