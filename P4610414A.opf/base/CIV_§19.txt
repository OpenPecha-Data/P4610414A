"That, Mañjuśrī, is the way a sick bodhisattva should concentrate his mind;he should live neither
in control of his mind, nor in indulgence of his mind.Why?To live by indulging the mind
is proper for foolsand to live in control of the mind is proper for the disciples.Therefore,
the bodhisattva should live neither in control nor in indulgence of his mind.Not living
in either of the two extremes is the domain of the bodhisattva.
