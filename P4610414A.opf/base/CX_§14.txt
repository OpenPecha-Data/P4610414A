Then, the venerable Ānanda addressed the Buddha:"Lord, from this day forth, I shall no longer
declare myself to be the foremost of the learned."

The Buddha said,"Do not be discouraged, Ānanda!Why?I pronounced you, Ānanda, the foremost of
the learned, with the disciples in mind,not considering the bodhisattvas.Look, Ānanda, look
at the bodhisattvas.They cannot be fathomed even by the wisest of men.Ānanda, one can fathom
the depths of the ocean,but one cannot fathom the depths of the wisdom, gnosis, memory,
incantations, or eloquence of the bodhisattvas.Ānanda, you should remain in equanimity
with regard to the deeds of the bodhisattvas.Why?Ānanda, these marvels displayed in a single
morning by the Licchavi Vimalakīrticould not be performed by the disciples and solitary
sages who have attained miraculous powers, were they to devote all their powers of incarnation
and transformation during one hundred thousand millions of aeons."
