Reverend Upāli, passions consist of conceptualizations. The ultimate nonexistence of these conceptualizations
and imaginary fabrications - that is the purity that is the intrinsic nature
of the mind.Misapprehensions are passions. The ultimate absence of misapprehensions is
the intrinsic nature of the mind.The presumption of self is passion. The absence of self
is the intrinsic nature of the mind.Reverend Upāli, all things are without production, destruction,
and duration, like magical illusions, clouds, and lightning;all things are evanescent,
not remaining even for an instant;all things are like dreams, hallucinations, and
unreal visions;all things are like the reflection of the moon in water and like a mirror-image;
they are born of mental construction.Those who know this are called the true upholders
of the disciplineand those disciplined in that way are indeed well disciplined.
