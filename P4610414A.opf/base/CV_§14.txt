Thus, a bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation can manifest all the splendors
of the virtues of all the buddha-fields within a single buddha-field.Likewise, he can place
all living beings in the palm of his right hand and can show them with the supernatural
speed of thoughtall the buddha-fieldswithout ever leaving his own buddha-field.He can display
in a single pore all the offerings ever offered to all the Buddhas of the ten directions,and
the orbs of all the suns, moons, and stars of the ten directions.He can inhale all
the hurricanes of the cosmic wind-atmospheres of the ten directions into his mouthwithout
harming his own bodyand without letting the forests and the grasses of the buddha-fields
be flattened.
