I remember, Lord, one day when I was taking a walk, the great Brahmā named Subhavyuha and the
ten thousand other Brahmās who accompanied him illuminated the place with their radiance
and, having bowed their heads at my feet, withdrew to one side and asked me,Reverend Aniruddha,
you have been proclaimed by the Buddha to be the foremost among those who possess the
divine eye. To what distance does the divine vision of the venerable Aniruddha extend?

I answered,Friends, I see the entire billion-world-galactic universe of the Lord Śākyamuni just
as plainly as a man of ordinary vision sees a myrobalan nut on the palm of his hand.
