And I, full of astonishment, having saluted this good man by touching his feet with my head,
took from around my neck a necklace of pearls worth one hundred thousand pieces of gold and
offered it to him.But he would not accept it.I then said to him,’Please accept, good man,
this necklace of pearls, out of compassion for me, and give it to whomsoever you wish.’
"

Then, Vimalakīrti took the pearls and divided them into two halves.He gave one half of them
to the lowliest poor of the city, who had been disdained by those present at the sacrifice.The
other half he offered to the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha.And he performed a miracle such that
all present beheld the universe called Marici and the Tathāgata Duṣprasāha.On the head of
the Tathāgata Duṣprasāha, the pearl necklace took the form of a pavilion, decorated with
strings of pearls, resting on four bases, with four columns, symmetrical, well constructed,
and lovely to behold.
