Reverend Mahākātyāyana, do not teach an ultimate reality endowed with activity, production,
and destruction!Reverend Mahākātyāyana, nothing was ever destroyed, is destroyed, or will
ever be destroyed. Such is the meaning of impermanence.The meaning of the realization of birthlessness,
through the realization of the voidness of the five aggregates, is the meaning
of suffering.The fact of the nonduality of self and selflessness is the meaning of selflessness.That
which has no intrinsic substance and no other sort of substance does not burn,
and what does not burn is not extinguished; such lack of extinction is the meaning of peace.
