As for these living beings, there is nothing to be applied,and there is nothing to be removed;
one has only to teach them the Dharma for them to realize the basis from which sicknesses
arise.What is this basis?It is object-perception.Insofar as apparent objects are perceived,
they are the basis of sickness.What things are perceived as objects?The three realms
of existence are perceived as objects.What is the thorough understanding of the basic, apparent
object?It is its nonperception, as no objects exist ultimately.What is nonperception?The
internal subject and the external object are not perceived dualistically. Therefore,
it is called nonperception."Mañjuśrī, thus should a sick bodhisattva control his own mind
in order to overcome old age, sickness, death, and birth.Such, Mañjuśrī, is the sickness of
the bodhisattva.If he takes it otherwise, all his efforts will be in vain.For example, one
is called ’hero’ when one overcomes all enemies.Just so, one is called ’bodhisattva’ when
one conquers the miseries of aging, sickness, and death.
