"Ānanda, this is a Dharma-door called ’Introduction to all the Buddha-qualities.’The bodhisattva
who enters this Dharma-door experiences neither joy nor pride when confronted by a buddha-field
adorned with the splendor of all noble qualities,and experiences neither sadness
nor aversion when confronted by a buddha-field apparently without that splendor,but in all
cases produces a profound reverence for all the Tathāgatas.Indeed, it is wonderful how
all the Lord Buddhas, who understand the equality of all things, manifest all sorts of buddha-fields
in order to develop living beings! "
