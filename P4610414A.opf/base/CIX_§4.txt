Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, without rising from his couch, magically emanated an incarnation-bodhisattva,whose
body was of golden color, adorned with the auspicious signs and marks,
and of such an appearance that he outshone the whole assembly.

The Licchavi Vimalakīrti addressed that incarnated bodhisattva:"Noble son, go in the direction
of the zenith and when you have crossed as many buddha-fields as there are sands in forty-two
Ganges rivers, you will reach a universe called Sarvagandhasugandhā,where you will
find the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa taking his meal.Go to him and, having bowed down at his feet,
make the following request of him:"’The Licchavi Vimalakīrti bows down one hundred thousand
times at your feet,O Lord, and asks after your health - if you have but little trouble,
little discomfort, little unrest; if you are strong, well, without complaint, and living
in touch with supreme happiness.’ "Having thus asked after his health, you should request
of him ’Vimalakīrti asks the Lord to give me the remains of your meal, with which he will
accomplish the buddha-work in the universe called Sahā.Thus, those living beings with inferior
aspirations will be inspired with lofty aspirations,and the good name of the Tathāgata
will be celebrated far and wide."
