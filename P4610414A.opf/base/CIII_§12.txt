You should accept alms by not taking anythingYou should see form like a man blind from birthhear
sounds as if they were echoessmell scents as if they were windsexperience tastes without
any discriminationtouch tangibles in awareness of the ultimate lack of contact in gnosisand
know things with the consciousness of an illusory creatureThat which is without intrinsic
substance and without imparted substance does not burnAnd what does not burn will not
be extinguished.
