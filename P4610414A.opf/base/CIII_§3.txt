Reverend Śāriputra, this is not the way to absorb yourself in contemplation.You should absorb
yourself in contemplation so that neither body nor mind appear anywhere in the triple world.You
should absorb yourself in contemplation in such a way that you can manifest all ordinary
behavior without forsaking cessation.You should absorb yourself in contemplation in
such a way that you can manifest the nature of an ordinary person without abandoning your
cultivated spiritual nature.You should absorb yourself in contemplation so that the mind
neither settles within nor moves without toward external forms.You should absorb yourself
in contemplation in such a way that the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment are manifest without
deviation toward any convictions.You should absorb yourself in contemplation in such
a way that you are released in liberation without abandoning the passions that are the province
of the world.Reverend Śāriputra, those who absorb themselves in contemplation in such
a way are declared by the Lord to be truly absorbed in contemplation.
