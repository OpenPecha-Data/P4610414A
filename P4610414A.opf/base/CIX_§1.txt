Thereupon, the venerable Śāriputra thought to himself,"If these great bodhisattvas do not adjourn
before noontime, when are they going to eat?"

The Licchavi Vimalakīrti, knowing telepathically the thought of the venerable Śāriputra, spoke
to him:"Reverend Śāriputra, the Tathāgata has taught the eight liberations. You should
concentrate on those liberations,listening to the Dharma with a mind free of preoccupations
with material things.Just wait a minute, reverend Śāriputra, and you will eat such food
as you have never before tasted."
