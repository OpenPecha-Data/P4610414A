Thereupon, Mañjuśrī, the crown prince, addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrti:"Good sir, how should
a bodhisattva regard all living beings?"Vimalakīrti replied, "Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva
should regard all livings beings (as a wise man regards the reflection of the moon in water
or) as magicians regard men created by magic.

(Vimalakīrti replied, "Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva should regard all livings beings )as a wise man
regards the reflection of the moon in water (or as magicians regard men created by magic).(He
should regard them as being )like a face in a mirror;He should regard them as being
(like a face in a mirror; )like the water of a mirage;disorder, see abovelike the sound of
an echo;like a mass of clouds in the sky;like the previous moment of a ball of foam;like
the appearance and disappearance of a bubble of water;like the core of a plantain tree;like
a flash of lightning;like the fifth great element;like the seventh sense-medium;like the
appearance of matter in an immaterial realm;like a sprout from a rotten seed;like a tortoise-hair
coat;like the fun of games for one who wishes to die;like the egoistic views of
a stream-winner;like a third rebirth of a once-returner;like the descent of a nonreturner
into a womb;like the existence of desire, hatred, and folly in a saint;like thoughts of avarice,
immorality, wickedness, and hostility in a bodhisattva who has attained tolerance;like
the instincts of passions in a Tathāgata;like the perception of color in one blind from
birth;like the inhalation and exhalation of an ascetic absorbed in the meditation of cessation;like
the track of a bird in the sky;like the erection of a eunuch;like the pregnancy
of a barren woman;like the unproduced passions of an emanated incarnation of the Tathāgata;like
dream-visions seen after waking;like the passions of one who is free of conceptualizations;like
fire burning without fuel;like the reincarnation of one who has attained ultimate
liberation."Precisely thus, Mañjuśrī, does a bodhisattva who realizes the ultimate selflessness
consider all beings."
