Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the patriarch Mahākāśyapa,"Reverend Mahākāśyapa, the Māras
who play the devil in the innumerable universes of the ten directionsare all bodhisattvas
dwelling in the inconceivable liberation, who are playing the devil in order to develop
living beings through their skill in liberative technique.Reverend Mahākāśyapa, all the
miserable beggars who come to the bodhisattvas of the innumerable universes of the ten directions
to ask for a hand, a foot,an ear, a nose, some blood, muscles, bones, marrow, an
eye, a torso, a head, a limb,a member, a throne, a kingdom, a country, a wife, a son, a daughter,
a slave, a slave-girl, a horse, an elephant, a chariot, a cart,gold, silver, jewels,
pearls, conches, crystal, coral, beryl, treasures,food, drink, elixirs, and clothes -these
demanding beggars are usually bodhisattvas living in the inconceivable liberation who,
through their skill in liberative technique, wish to test and thus demonstrate the firmness
of the high resolve of the bodhisattvas.Why?Reverend Mahākāśyapa, the bodhisattvas demonstrate
that firmness by means of terrible austerities.Ordinary persons have no power to be
thus demanding of bodhisattvas, unless they are granted the opportunity. They are not capable
of killing and depriving in that manner without being freely given the chance."Reverend
Mahākāśyapa, just as a glowworm cannot eclipse the light of the sun,so reverend Mahākāśyapa,
it is not possible without special allowance that an ordinary person can thus attack
and deprive a bodhisattva.

Reverend Mahākāśyapa, just as a donkey could not muster an attack on a wild elephant,even so,
reverend Mahākāśyapa, one who is not himself a bodhisattva cannot harass another bodhisattva,and
only a bodhisattva can tolerate the harassment of another bodhisattva.Reverend Mahākāśyapa,
such is the introduction to the power of the knowledge of liberative technique
of the bodhisattvas who live in the inconceivable liberation."
