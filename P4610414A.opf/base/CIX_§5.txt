At that, the incarnated bodhisattva said, "Very good!" to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and obeyed
his instructions.In sight of all the bodhisattvas, he turned his face upward and was gone,
and they saw him no more.

When he reached the universe Sarvagandhasugandhā,he bowed down at the feet of the Tathāgata
Sugandhakūṭa and said,"Lord, the bodhisattva Vimalakīrti, bowing down at the feet of the Lord,
greets the Lord, saying:’Do you have little trouble, little discomfort, and little unrest?
Are you strong, well, without complaint, and living in touch with the supreme happiness?’

He then requests, having bowed down one hundred thousand times at the feet of the Lord:’May
the Lord be gracious and give to me the remains of his meal in order to accomplish the buddha-work
in the universe called Sahā.Then, those living beings who aspire to inferior ways
may gain the intelligence to aspire to the great Dharma of the Buddha,and the name of the
Buddha will be celebrated far and wide.’"
