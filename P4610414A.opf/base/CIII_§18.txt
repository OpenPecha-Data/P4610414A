if, entertaining all false views, you find neither extremes nor middle;if, bound up in the eight
adversities, you do not obtain favorable conditions;if, assimilating the passions, you
do not attain purification;if the dispassion of all living beings is your dispassion, reverend;if
those who make offerings to you are not thereby purified;if those who offer you
food, reverend, still fall into the three bad migrations;if you associate with all Maras;
if you entertain all passions;if the nature of passions is the nature of a reverend;if you
have hostile feelings toward all living beings;if you despise all the Buddhas; if you criticize
all the teachings of the Buddha; if you do not rely on the Sangha;and finally, if you
never enter ultimate liberation.
