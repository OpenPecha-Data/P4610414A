"Householder, whence came this sickness of yours?How long will it continue?How does it stand?How
can it be alleviated?"

Vimalakīrti replied,"Mañjuśrī, my sickness comes from ignorance and the thirst for existenceand
it will last as long as do the sicknesses of all living beings.Were all living beings
to be free from sickness, I also would not be sick.Why?Mañjuśrī, for the bodhisattva, the
world consists only of living beings, and sickness is inherent in living in the world.Were
all living beings free of sickness, the bodhisattva also would be free of sickness.
