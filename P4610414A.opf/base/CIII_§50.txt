"’Maitreya, the Buddha has prophesied that only one more birth stands between you and unexcelled,
perfect enlightenment.What kind of birth does this prophecy concern, Maitreya?Is it
past? Is it future? Or is it present?If it is a past birth, it is already finished. If it
is a future birth, it will never arrive. If it is a present birth, it does not abide.For the
Buddha has declared, "Bhikshus, in a single moment, you are born, you age, you die, you
transmigrate, and you are reborn.""’Then might the prophecy concern birthlessness?But birthlessness
applies to the stage of destiny for the ultimate,in which there is neither prophecy
nor attainment of perfect enlightenment.
