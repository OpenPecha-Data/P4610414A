Having shown such a miracle, Vimalakīrti said,’The giver who makes gifts to the lowliest poor
of the city, considering them as worthy of offering as the Tathāgata himself, the giver
who gives without any discrimination, impartially,with no expectation of reward, and with
great love -this giver, I say, totally fulfills the Dharma-sacrifice.’ "
