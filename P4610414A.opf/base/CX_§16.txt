the Buddha declared,"Noble sons, there is a liberation of bodhisattvas called ’destructible
and indestructible.’You must train yourselves in this liberation.What is it?’Destructible’
refers to compounded things.’Indestructible’ refers to the uncompounded.But the bodhisattva
should neither destroy the compoundednor rest in the uncompounded.
