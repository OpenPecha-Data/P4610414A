At that moment, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, having focused himself in concentration,performed
a miraculous featsuch that the Lord Tathāgata Merupradīparāja, in the universe Merudhvaja,
sent to this universe thirty-two hundred thousand thrones.These thrones were so tall, spacious,
and beautifulthat the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Sakras, Brahmās, Lokapālas, and
other gods had never before seen the like. The thrones descended from the sky and came to
rest in the house of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti.The thirty-two hundred thousand thrones arranged
themselves without crowding and the house seemed to enlarge itself accordingly.The
great city of Vaiśālī did not become obscured;neither did the land of Jambudvīpa, nor the
world of four continents.Everything else appeared just as it was before.
