Reverend R훮hula, you should not teach the benefits and virtues of renunciation in the way that
you do.Why?Renunciation is itself the very absence of virtues and benefits.Reverend R훮hula,
one may speak of benefits and virtues in regard to compounded thingsbut renunciation
is uncompounded, and there can be no question of benefits and virtues in regard to the uncompounded.Reverend
R훮hula, renunciation is not material but is free of matter.It is free of
the extreme views of beginning and end.It is the path of liberation.It is praised by the
wise, embraced by the saintsand causes the defeat of all M훮ras. It liberates from the five
states of existencepurifies the five eyes, cultivates the five powers, and supports the
five spiritual faculties.Renunciation is totally harmless to others and is not adulterated
with evil things. It disciplines the heterodoxtranscending all denominations. It is the bridge
over the swamp of desirewithout grasping, and free of the habits of I and mine.It is
without attachment and without disturbance, eliminating all commotion.It disciplines ones
own mind and protects the minds of others.It favors mental quiescence and stimulates transcendental
analysis.It is irreproachable in all respects and so is called renunciation. Those
who leave the mundane in this way are called truly renunciant.
