The bodhisattva Prabhāketu declared,"To say that the four main elements are one thing and the
etheric space-element another is dualistic.The four main elements are themselves the nature
of space.The past itself is also the nature of space. The future itself is also the nature
of space. Likewise, the present itself is also the nature of space.The gnosis that penetrates
the elements in such a way is the entrance into nonduality."
