"There are two reasons the bodhisattvas who do aspire to the profound Dharma hurt themselvesand
do not attain the tolerance of the ultimate birthlessness of things.What are these two?These
bodhisattvas despise and reproach the beginner bodhisattvas, who have not been practicing
for a long time,and they do not initiate them or instruct them in the profound teaching.Having
no great respect for this profound teaching, they are not careful about its rules.They
help living beings by means of material gifts and do not help them by means of the
gift of the Dharma.Such, Maitreya, are the two reasons the bodhisattvas who aspire to the
profound Dharma hurt themselvesand will not quickly attain the tolerance of the ultimate
birthlessness of all things."
