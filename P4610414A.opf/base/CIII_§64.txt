"The Licchavi Vimalakīrti, having received the goddesses, said to them,’Now that you have been
given to me by Māra,you should all conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.’"He
then exhorted them with discourse suitable for their development toward enlightenment,
and soon they conceived the spirit of enlightenment.

He then said to them, ’You have just conceived the spirit of enlightenment.From now on, you
should devote yourselves to find joy in pleasures of the Dharma, and should take no pleasure
in desires.’ "

They then asked him, ’What is "joy in the pleasures of the Dharma"?’ "

He declared, ’It is the joy of unbreakable faith in the Buddha,of wishing to hear the Dharma,of
serving the Sanghaand honoring the spiritual benefactors without pride.It is the joy of
renunciation of the whole world,of not being fixed in objects,of considering the five aggregates
to be like murderers,of considering the elements to be like venomous serpents,and
of considering the sense-media to be like an empty town.It is the joy of always guarding
the spirit of enlightenment,of helping living beings,of sharing through generosity,of not
slackening in morality,of control and tolerance in patience,of thorough cultivation of virtue
by effort,of total absorption in meditation,and of absence of passions in wisdom.It is
the joy of extending enlightenment,of conquering the Māras,of destroying the passions,and
of purifying the buddha-field.It is the joy of accumulating all virtues, in order to cultivate
the auspicious marks and signs.Order is differentIt is the joy of the liberation of
nonintimidation when hearing the profound teaching.It is the joy of exploration of the three
doors of liberation,and of the realization of liberation.It is the joy of being an ornament
of the seat of enlightenment,and of not attaining liberation at the wrong time.It is
the joy of serving those of equal fortune,of not hating or resenting those of superior fortune,of
serving the spiritual benefactors,and of avoiding sinful friends.It is the joy of
the superior gladness of faith and devotion to the Dharma.It is the joy of acquiring liberative
techniquesand of the conscious cultivation of the aids to enlightenment.Thus, the bodhisattva
admires and finds joy in the delights of the Dharma.’
