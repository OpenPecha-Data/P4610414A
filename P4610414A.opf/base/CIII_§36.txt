Then the two monks said, This householder is extremely well endowed with wisdom.The reverend
Upāli, who was proclaimed by the Lord as the foremost of the upholders of the discipline,
is not his equal.

I then said to the two monks,Do not entertain the notion that he is a mere householder! Why?With
the exception of the Tathāgata himself, there is no disciple or bodhisattva capable of
competing with his eloquence or rivaling the brilliance of his wisdom.
