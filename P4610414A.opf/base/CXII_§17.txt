"Maitreya, there are two gestures of the bodhisattvas.What are they?The first gesture is to
believe in all sorts of phrases and words,and the second gesture is to penetrate exactly the
profound principle of the Dharma without being afraid.Such are the two gestures of the
bodhisattvas.Maitreya, it must be known that the bodhisattvas who believe in all sorts of
words and phrases, and apply themselves accordingly, are beginnersand not experienced in religious
practice.But the bodhisattvas who read, hear, believe, and teach this profound teaching
with its impeccable expressions reconciling dichotomies and its analyses of stages
of development these are veterans in the religious practice.
