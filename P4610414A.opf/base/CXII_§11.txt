"’They contain the message of selflessness, living-beinglessness, lifelessness, personlessness,voidness,
signlessness, wishlessness, nonperformance,nonproduction, and nonoccurrence.
"’They make possible the attainment of the seat of enlightenment and set in motion the wheel
of the Dharma.They are approved and praised by the chiefs of the gods, nagas, yakṣas, gandharvas,
asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas.They preserve unbroken the heritage of
the holy Dharma, contain the treasury of the Dharma, and represent the summit of the Dharma-worship.They
are upheld by all holy beingsand teach all the bodhisattva practices.They
induce the unmistaken understanding of the Dharma in its ultimate sense.They certify that
all things are impermanent, miserable, selfless, and peaceful, thus epitomizing the Dharma.They
cause the abandonment of avarice, immorality, malice, laziness, forgetfulness, foolishness,
and jealousy, as well as bad convictions, adherence to objects, and all opposition.They
are praised by all the Buddhas.They are the medicines for the tendencies of mundane
life,and they authentically manifest the great happiness of liberation.To teach correctly,
to uphold, to investigate, and to understand such Scriptures, thus incorporating into one’s
own life the holy Dharma - that is the "Dharma-worship."
