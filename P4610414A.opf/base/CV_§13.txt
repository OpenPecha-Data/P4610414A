"Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, there are beings who become disciplined after an immense period
of evolution, and there are also those who are disciplined after a short period of evolution.The
bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation, for the sake of disciplining
those living beings who are disciplined through immeasurable periods of evolution,
can make the passing of a week seem like the passing of an aeon,and he can make the passing
of an aeon seem like the passing of a week for those who are disciplined through a short
period of evolution.The living beings who are disciplined through an immeasurable period
of evolution actually perceive a week to be the passing of an aeon, and those disciplined
by a short period of evolution actually perceive an aeon to be the passing of a week. "
