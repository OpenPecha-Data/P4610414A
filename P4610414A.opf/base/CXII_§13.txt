"Prince of gods, when the prince Candracchattra had heard this definition of Dharma-worship
from the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja, he attained the conformative tolerance of ultimate birthlessness;and,
taking his robes and ornaments, he offered them to the Buddha Bhaiṣajyarāja,
saying,’When the Tathāgata will be in ultimate liberation, I wish to defend his holy Dharma,to
protect it, and to worship it.May the Tathāgata grant me his supernatural blessing,
that I may be able to conquer Māra and all adversaries and to incorporate in all my lives
the holy Dharma of the Buddha!’

"The Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja, knowing the high resolve of Candracchattra, prophesied to him
that he would be, at a later time, in the future, the protector, guardian, and defender of
the city of the holy Dharma.
