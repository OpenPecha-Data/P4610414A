At that moment, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti entered into such a concentration that those monks
were caused to remember their various former existencesin which they had produced the roots
of virtue by serving five hundred Buddhas for the sake of perfect enlightenment. As soon
as their own spirits of enlightenment had become clear to themthey bowed at the feet of that
good man and pressed their palms together in reverence. He taught them the Dharma, and
they all attained the stage of irreversibility from the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.It
occurred to me then, The disciples, who do not know the thoughts or the inclinations
of others, are not able to teach the Dharma to anyone. Why? These disciples are not
expert in discerning the superiority and inferiority of the spiritual faculties of living
beings, and they are not always in a state of concentration like the Tathāgata, the Saint,
the perfectly accomplished Buddha.
