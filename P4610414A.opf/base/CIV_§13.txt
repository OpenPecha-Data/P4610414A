"The sick bodhisattva should recognize that sensation is ultimately nonsensation,but he should
not realize the cessation of sensation. Although both pleasure and pain are abandoned when
the buddha-qualities are fully accomplished,there is then no sacrifice of the great compassion
for all living beings living in the bad migrations.Thus, recognizing in his own suffering
the infinite sufferings of these living beings, the bodhisattva correctly contemplates
these living beings and resolves to cure all sicknesses.
