The Licchavi Vimalakīrti addressed the whole gathering of bodhisattvas:"Good sirs, is there
any among you who would like to go to that buddha-field to bring back some food?"But, restrained
by the supernatural power of Mañjuśrī, none of them volunteered to go.

The Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to crown prince Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, are you not ashamed of such
a gathering?"

Mañjuśrī replied, "Noble sir, did not the Tathāgata declare, ’Those who are unlearned should
not be despised’?"
