The Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Jagatīṃdhara,"Jagatīṃdhara, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
to inquire about his illness."

Jagatīṃdhara replied, "My Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about
his illness.Why?Lord, I remember that one day, when I was at home,the wicked Māra, (disguised
as Indra) and surrounded with twelve thousand heavenly maidens,(the wicked Māra,) disguised
as Indra (and surrounded with twelve thousand heavenly maidens,) approached me with
the sounds of music and singing.Having saluted me by touching my feet with his head, he
withdrew with his retinue to one side.

I then, thinking he was Sakra, the king of the gods,said to him,’Welcome, O Kauśika! You should
remain consciously aware in the midst of the pleasures of desire.You should often think
on impermanence and strive to utilize the essential in body, life, and wealth.’

"Māra then said to me,’Good sir, accept from me these twelve thousand divine maidens and make
them your servants.’ "

I replied,’O Kauśika, do not offer me, who am religious and a son of the Sakya, things which
are not appropriate.It is not proper for me to have these maidens.’
