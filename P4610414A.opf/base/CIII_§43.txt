Reverend Ānanda, what are you doing on the threshold of this house with your bowl in your hand
so early in the morning?

I replied: The body of the Lord manifests some indispositionand he needs some milk. Therefore,
I have come to fetch some.

Vimalakīrti then said to me, Reverend Ānanda, do not say such a thing!Reverend Ānanda, the body
of the Tathāgata is tough as a diamond, having eliminated all the instinctual traces of
evil and being endowed with all goodness.How could disease or discomfort affect such a body?
