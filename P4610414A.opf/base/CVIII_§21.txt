The bodhisattva GambhÄ«ramati declared,"It is dualistic to say that voidness is one thing, signlessness
another, and wishlessness still another.What is void has no sign.What has no sign
has no wish.Where there is no wish there is no process of thought, mind, or consciousness.To
see the doors of all liberations in the door of one liberation is the entrance into
nonduality."
