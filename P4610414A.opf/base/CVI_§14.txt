Śāriputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?

Goddess: Although I have sought my "female state" for these twelve years, I have not yet found
it.Reverend Śāriputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask
her,"What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?"

Śāriputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?

Goddess: Just so, reverend Śāriputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you think,"What
prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself
out of her female state?"
