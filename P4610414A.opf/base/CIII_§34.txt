Lord, while I was giving those two monks some religious discourse, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
came there and said to meReverend Upāli, do not aggravate further the sins of these two monks.
Without perplexing them, relieve their remorse.Reverend Upāli, sin is not to be apprehended
within, or without, or between the two. Why?The Buddha has said, Living beings are
afflicted by the passions of thought, and they are purified by the purification of thought.Reverend
Upāli, the mind is neither within nor without, nor is it to be apprehended between
the two.Sin is just the same as the mind, and all things are just the same as sin. They
do not escape this same reality.Reverend Upāli, this nature of the mind, by virtue of which
your mind, reverend, is liberated - does it ever become afflicted?

Never, I replied.

Reverend Upāli, the minds of all living beings have that very nature.
