At that moment the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, let us
take these many living beings into the presence of the Lord, so that they may see the Tathāgata
and bow down to him!"

Mañjuśrī replied, "Noble sir, send them if you feel the time is right!"

Thereupon the Licchavi Vimalakīrti performed the miraculous featof placing the entire assembly,
replete with thrones, upon his right hand and then,having transported himself magically
into the presence of the Buddha,placing it on the ground.He bowed down at the feet of the
Buddha,circumambulated him to the right seven times with palms together, and withdrew to
one side.

The bodhisattvas who had come from the buddha-field of the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭadescended from
their lion-thrones and,bowing down at the feet of the Buddha, placed their palms together
in reverence and withdrew to one side.And the other bodhisattvas, great spiritual heroes,
and the great disciples descended from their thrones likewise and, having bowed at the
feet of the Buddha, withdrew to one side.Likewise all those Indras, Brahmās, Lokapālas, and
gods bowed at the feet of the Buddha, placed their palms together in reverence and withdrew
to one side.

Then, the Buddha, having delighted those bodhisattvas with greetings, declared,"Noble sons,
be seated upon your thrones!"Thus commanded by the Buddha, they took their thrones.
