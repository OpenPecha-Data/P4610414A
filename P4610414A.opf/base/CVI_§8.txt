Then, the goddess said to the venerable Śāriputra,"Reverend Śāriputra, why do you shake these
flowers?"Śāriputra replied, "Goddess, these flowers are not proper for religious personsand
so we are trying to shake them off."The goddess said, "Do not say that, reverend Śāriputra.Why?These
flowers are proper indeed!Why?Such flowers have neither constructual thought
nor discrimination.But the elder Śāriputra has both constructual thought and discrimination."Reverend
Śāriputra, impropriety for one who has renounced the world for the discipline
of the rightly taught Dharma consists of constructual thought and discrimination,yet the
elders are full of such thoughts.One who is without such thoughts is always proper."Reverend
Śāriputra, see how these flowers do not stick to the bodies of these great spiritual heroes,
the bodhisattvas! This is because they have eliminated constructual thoughts and discriminations.
"For example, evil spirits have power over fearful men but cannot disturb the
fearless.Likewise, those intimidated by fear of the world are in the power of forms, sounds,
smells, tastes, and textures,which do not disturb those who are free from fear of the
passions inherent in the constructive world.Thus, these flowers stick to the bodies of those
who have not eliminated their instincts for the passionsand do not stick to the bodies
of those who have eliminated their instincts.Therefore, the flowers do not stick to the
bodies of these bodhisattvas, who have abandoned all instincts."
