Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, what is the ’family
of the Tathāgatas’?"

Mañjuśrī replied, "Noble sir, the family of the Tathāgatas consists of all basic egoism;of ignorance
and the thirst for existence;of lust, hate, and folly;of the four misapprehensions,of
the five obscurations,of the six media of sense,of the seven abodes of consciousness,of
the eight false paths,of the nine causes of irritation,of the paths of ten sins.Such is
the family of the Tathāgatas.In short, noble sir, the sixty-two kinds of convictions constitute
the family of the Tathāgatas!"
