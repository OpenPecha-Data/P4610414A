Reverend Mahākāśyapa, to avoid the houses of the wealthy, and to favor the houses of the poor
- this is partiality in benevolence.Reverend Mahākāśyapa, you should dwell on the fact of
the equality of things, and you should seek alms with consideration for all living beings
at all times.You should beg your food in awareness of the ultimate non-existence of food.You
should seek alms for the sake of eliminating the materialism of others.When you enter
a town, you should keep in mind its actual voidnessyet you should proceed through it in order
to develop men and women.You should enter homes as if entering the family of the Buddha.
