Thereupon, in that assembly, the bodhisattvas, the great disciples, the Sakras, the Brahmās,
the Lokapālas, and the gods and goddesses, all had this thought:"Surely the conversations
of the young prince Mañjuśrī and that good man will result in a profound teaching of the
Dharma."Thus, eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred disciples, a great number of Sakras,
Brahmās, Lokapālas, and many hundreds of thousands of gods and goddesses, all followed
the crown prince Mañjuśrī to listen to the Dharma.And the crown prince Mañjuśrī, surrounded
and followed by these bodhisattvas, disciples, Sakras, Brahmās, Lokapālas, gods, and goddesses,
entered the great city of Vaiśālī.
