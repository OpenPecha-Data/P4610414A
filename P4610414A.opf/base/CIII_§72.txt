"’The Dharma-sacrifice consists of heroic strength, consummated in the upholding of the holy
Dharma;of the power of life, consummated in the means of unification;of the absence of pride,
consummated in becoming the slave and the disciple of all living beings;of the gain of
body, health, and wealth, consummated by the extraction of essence from the essenceless;of
mindfulness, consummated by the six remembrances;of positive thought, consummated through
the truly enjoyable Dharma;of purity of livelihood, consummated by correct spiritual practice;of
the respect of saints, consummated by joyful and faithful service;of soberness of
mind, consummated by absence of dislike for ordinary people;of high resolve, consummated
by renunciation;of skill in erudition, consummated by religious practice;of retirement in
solitary retreats, consummated by understanding things free of passions;of introspective
meditation, consummated by attainment of the Buddha-gnosis;of the stage of the practice of
yoga, consummated by the yoga of liberating all living beings from their passions. "’
