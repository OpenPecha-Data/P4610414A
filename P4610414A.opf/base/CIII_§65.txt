"Thereupon, Māra said to the goddesses,’Now come along and let us return home.’

"They said,’You gave us to this householder.Now we should enjoy the delights of the Dharma and
should no longer enjoy the pleasures of desires.’

"Then Māra said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti,’If it is so that the bodhisattva, the spiritual
hero, has no mental attachment, and gives away all his possessions, then, householder, please
give me these goddesses.’

"Vimalakīrti replied, ’They are given,Māra. Go home with your retinue.May you fulfill the religious
aspirations of all living beings!’ "

Then the goddesses, saluting Vimalakīrti, said to him,’Householder, how should we live in the
abode of the Māras?’ "
