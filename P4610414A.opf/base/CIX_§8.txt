Then, the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa poured some of his food, impregnated with all perfumes, into
a fragrant vessel and gave it to the incarnation-bodhisattva.And the ninety million bodhisattvas
of that universe volunteered to go along with him:"Lord, we also would like to go
to that universe Sahā, to see, honor, and serve the Buddha Śākyamuni and to see Vimalakīrti
and those bodhisattvas."

The Tathāgata declared,"Noble sons, go ahead if you think it is the right time.But, lest those
living beings become mad and intoxicated, go without your perfumes.And, lest those living
beings of the Sahā world become jealous of you, change your bodies to hide your beauty.And
do not conceive ideas of contempt and aversion for that universe.Why?Noble sons, a buddha-field
is a field of pure space,but the Lord Buddhas, in order to develop living beings,
do not reveal all at once the pure realm of the Buddha."
