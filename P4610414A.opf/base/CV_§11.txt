"Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, the bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation
can pour into a single pore of his skin all the waters of the four great oceans,without injuring
the water-animals such as fish, tortoises, crocodiles, frogs, and other creatures,and
without the nagas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and asuras even being aware of where they are.And
the whole operation is visible without any injury or disturbance to any of those living
beings.
