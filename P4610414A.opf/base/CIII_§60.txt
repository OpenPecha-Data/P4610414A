"’Noble son, when bodhisattvas are thus endowed with the transcendences,the roots of virtue,
the ability to develop living beings,and the incorporation of the holy Dharma,whether they
lift up their feet or put them down,they all come from the seat of enlightenment. They come
from the qualities of the Buddha, and stand on the qualities of the Buddha.’
