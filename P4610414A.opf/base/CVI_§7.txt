Thereupon, a certain goddess who lived in that house,having heard this teaching of the Dharma
of the great heroic bodhisattvas,and being delighted, pleased, and overjoyed,manifested
herself in a material bodyand showered the great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas, and the
great disciples with heavenly flowers.When the flowers fell on the bodies of the bodhisattvas,
they fell off on the floor,but when they fell on the bodies of the great disciples,
they stuck to them and did not fall.The great disciples shook the flowers and even tried
to use their magical powers, but still the flowers would not shake off.
