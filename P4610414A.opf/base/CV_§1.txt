Thereupon, the venerable Śāriputra had this thought:"There is not even a single chair in this
house. Where are these disciples and bodhisattvas going to sit?"

The Licchavi Vimalakīrti read the thought of the venerable Śāriputra and said,"Reverend Śāriputra,
did you come here for the sake of the Dharma? Or did you come here for the sake of
a chair?"
