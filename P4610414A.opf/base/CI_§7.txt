Then the Licchavi Bodhisattva Ratnākara and five hundred young Licchavis, each holding a parasol
formed of seven jewels, left the town of Vaiśālī and went to the Āmrapālī grove, approaching
the Blessed One;having reached him, after having saluted the feet of the Blessed One
with their heads and after having circled round him seven times, they each offered him
their parasols and, having made this offering, stood to one side.
