Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti knowingly addressed those bodhisattvas who had come from the
buddha-field of the Lord Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa:"Noble sirs, how does the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa
teach his Dharma?"

They replied,"The Tathāgata does not teach the Dharma by means of sound and language.He disciplines
the bodhisattvas only by means of perfumes.At the foot of each perfume-tree sits a
bodhisattva,and the trees emit perfumes like this one.From the moment they smell that perfume,
the bodhisattvas attain the concentration called ’source of all bodhisattva-virtues.’From
the moment they attain that concentration, all the bodhisattva-virtues are produced
in them."
