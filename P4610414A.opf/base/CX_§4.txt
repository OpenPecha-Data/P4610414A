Then the venerable Ānanda asked the Buddha,"Lord, (what is this perfume, ) the likes of which
I have never smelled before?""Lord, what is this perfume, (the likes of which I have never
smelled before?" )

The Buddha answered, "Ānanda, this perfume emanates from all the pores of all these bodhisattvas."

Śāriputra added,"Venerable Ānanda, this same perfume emanates from all our pores as well!"

Ānanda: Where does the perfume come from?

Śāriputra: The Licchavi Vimalakīrti obtained some food from the universe called Sarvagandhasugandhā,
the buddha-field of the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa,and this perfume emanates from the
bodies of all those who partook of that food.
