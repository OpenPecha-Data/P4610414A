When the bodhisattvas had given their explanations, they all addressed the crown prince Mañjuśrī:"Mañjuśrī,
what is the bodhisattva’s entrance into nonduality?"

Mañjuśrī replied,"Good sirs, you have all spoken well.Nevertheless, all your explanations are
themselves dualistic.To know no one teaching, to express nothing, to say nothing, to explain
nothing, to announce nothing, to indicate nothing, and to designate nothing -that is
the entrance into nonduality."
