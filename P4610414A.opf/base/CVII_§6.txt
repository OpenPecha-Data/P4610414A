Thereupon, the bodhisattva Sarvarupasamdarsana, who was present in that assembly,addressed the
Licchavi Vimalakīrti:"Householder, where are your father and mother, your children, your
wife, your servants, your maids, your laborers, and your attendants? Where are your friends,
your relatives, and your kinsmen? Where are your servants, your horses, your elephants,
your chariots, your bodyguards, and your bearers?"Thus addressed, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
spoke the following verses to the bodhisattva Sarvarupasamdarsana:

Of the true bodhisattvas, The mother is the transcendence of wisdom, The father is the skill
in liberative technique; The Leaders are born of such parents.Their wife is the joy in the
Dharma, Love and compassion are their daughters, The Dharma and the truth are their sons;
And their home is deep thought on the meaning of voidness.All the passions are their disciples,
Controlled at will. Their friends are the aids to enlightenment; Thereby they realize
supreme enlightenment.Their companions, ever with them, Are the six transcendences. Their
consorts are the means of unification, Their music is the teaching of the Dharma.The incantations
make their garden, Which blossoms with the flowers of the factors of enlightenment,
With trees of the great wealth of the Dharma, And fruits of the gnosis of liberation.Their
pool consists of the eight liberations, Filled with the water of concentration, Covered
with the lotuses of the seven impurities - Who bathes therein becomes immaculate.Their
bearers are the six superknowledges, Their vehicle is the unexcelled Mahāyāna, Their driver
is the spirit of enlightenment, And their path is the eightfold peace.Their ornaments
are the auspicious signs, And the eighty marks; Their garland is virtuous aspiration, And
their clothing is good conscience and consideration.Their wealth is the holy Dharma, And their
business is its teaching, Their great income is pure practice, And it is dedicated to
the supreme enlightenment.Their bed consists of the four contemplations, And its spread is
the pure livelihood, And their awakening consists of gnosis, Which is constant learning
and meditation.Their food is the ambrosia of the teachings, And their drink is the juice of
liberation. Their bath is pure aspiration, And morality their unguent and perfume.Having
conquered the enemy passions, They are invincible heroes. Having subdued the four Māras,
They raise their standard on the field of enlightenment.They manifest birth voluntarily,Yet
they are not born, nor do they originate.They shine in all the fields of the Buddhas,Just
like the rising sun.Though they worship Buddhas by the millions, With every conceivable
offering, They never dwell upon the least difference Between the Buddhas and themselves.They
journey through all Buddha-fields In order to bring benefit to living beings, Yet they
see those fields as just like empty space, Free of any conceptual notions of "living beings."The
fearless bodhisattvas can manifest, All in a single instant, The forms, sounds, and
manners of behavior Of all living beings.Although they recognize the deeds of Māras, They
can get along even with these Māras; For even such activities may be manifested By those
perfected in liberative technique.They play with illusory manifestations In order to develop
living beings, Showing themselves to be old or sick, And even manifesting their own deaths.They
demonstrate the burning of the earth In the consuming flames of the world’s end,
In order to demonstrate impermanence To living beings with the notion of permanence.Invited
by hundreds of thousands of living beings, All in the same country, They partake of offerings
at the homes of all, And dedicate all for the sake of enlightenment.They excel in all
esoteric sciences, And in the many different crafts, And they bring forth the happiness
Of all living beings.By devoting themselves as monks To all the strange sects of the world,
They develop all those beings Who have attached themselves to dogmatic views.They may become
suns or moons, Indras, Brahmās, or lords of creatures, They may become fire or water
Or earth or wind.During the short aeons of maladies, They become the best holy medicine; They
make beings well and happy, And bring about their liberation.During the short aeons of
famine, They become food and drink. Having first alleviated thirst and hunger, They teach
the Dharma to living beings.During the short aeons of swords, They meditate on love, Introducing
to nonviolence Hundreds of millions of living beings.In the middle of great battles
They remain impartial to both sides; For bodhisattvas of great strength Delight in reconciliation
of conflict.In order to help the living beings, They voluntarily descend into The
hells which are attached To all the inconceivable buddha-fields.They manifest their lives
In all the species of the animal kingdom, Teaching the Dharma everywhere. Thus they are
called "Leaders."They display sensual enjoyment to the worldlings, And trances to the meditative.
They completely conquer the Māras, And allow them no chance to prevail.Just as it
can be shown that a lotus Cannot exist in the center of a fire, So they show the ultimate
unreality Of both pleasures and trances.They intentionally become courtesans In order to win
men over, And, having caught them with the hook of desire, They establish them in the buddha-gnosis.In
order to help living beings, They always become chieftains, Captains, priests,
and ministers, Or even prime ministers.For the sake of the poor, They become inexhaustible
treasures, Causing those to whom they give their gifts To conceive the spirit of enlightenment.They
become invincible champions, For the sake of the proud and the vain, And,
having conquered all their pride, They start them on the quest for enlightenment.They always
stand at the head Of those terrified with fright, And, having bestowed fearlessness upon
them, They develop them toward enlightenment.They become great holy men, With the superknowledges
and pure continence, And thus induce living beings to the morality Of tolerance,
gentleness, and discipline.Here in the world, they fearlessly behold Those who are masters
to be served, And they become their servants or slaves, Or serve as their disciples.Well
trained in liberative technique,They demonstrate all activities,Whichever possibly may be
a meansTo make beings delight in the Dharma.Their practices are infinite; And their spheres
of influence are infinite; Having perfected an infinite wisdom, They liberate an infinity
of living beings.Even for the Buddhas themselves, During a million aeons, Or even a hundred
million aeons, It would be hard to express all their virtues.Except for some inferior
living beings, Without any intelligence at all, Is there añone with any discernment Who,
having heard this teaching, Would not wish for the supreme enlightenment?
