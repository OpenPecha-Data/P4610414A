The bodhisattva Siṃhamati declared,"To say, ’This is impure’ and ’This is immaculate’ makes
for duality.One who, attaining equanimity, forms no conception of impurity or immaculateness,yet
is not utterly without conception, has equanimity without any attainment of equanimity
- he enters the absence of conceptual knots.Thus, he enters into nonduality."
