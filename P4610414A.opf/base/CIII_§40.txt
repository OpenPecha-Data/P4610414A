Young men, renounce the world in the light of this clear teaching!The appearance of the Buddha
is extremely rare.Human life endowed with leisure and opportunity is very hard to obtain.
To be a human being is very precious.

The young men complained: But, householder, we have heard the Tathāgata declare that one should
not renounce the world without the permission of ones parents.

Vimalakīrti answered: Young men, you should cultivate yourselves intensively to conceive the
spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.That in itself will be your renunciation and
high ordination!
