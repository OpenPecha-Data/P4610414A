Reverend Śāriputra, he who is interested in the Dharma is not interested in recognizing suffering,abandoning
its origination,realizing its cessation,or practicing the path.Why?The Dharma
is ultimately without formulationand without verbalization.Who verbalizes: ’Suffering
should be recognized, origination should be eliminated, cessation should be realized, the
path should be practiced,’ is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in verbalization.
"Reverend Śāriputra, the Dharma is calm and peaceful.Those who are engaged in production
and destruction are not interested in the Dharma, are not interested in solitude, but
are interested in production and destruction."Furthermore, reverend Śāriputra, the Dharma
is without taint and free of defilement.He who is attached to anything, even to liberation,is
not interested in the Dharma but is interested in the taint of desire.The Dharma is not
an object.He who pursues objects is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in objects.The
Dharma is without acceptance or rejection.He who holds on to things or lets go
of things is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in holding and letting go.
