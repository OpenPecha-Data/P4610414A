Then the venerable Ānanda addressed the Licchavi Vimalakīrti:"How long will this perfume remain?"

Vimalakīrti: Until is it digested.

Ānanda: When will it be digested?

Vimalakīrti: It will be digested in forty-nine days,and its perfume will emanate for seven days
more after that,but there will be no trouble of indigestion during that time.
