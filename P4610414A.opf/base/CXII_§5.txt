"Let us suppose, prince of gods, that this billion-world-galactic universe were as full of Tathāgatasas
it is covered with groves of sugarcane, with rosebushes, with bamboo thickets,
with herbs, and with flowers,and that a noble son or daughter were to honor them, revere
them, respect and adore them, offering them all sorts of comforts and offerings for an aeon
or more than an aeon.And let us suppose that, these Tathāgatas having entered ultimate liberation,
he or she honored each of themby enshrining their preserved bodies in a memorial
stupa made of precious stones,each as large as a world with four great continents, rising
as high as the world of Brahmā,adorned with parasols, banners, standards, and lamps.And
let us suppose finally that, having erected all these stupas for the Tathāgatas,he or she
were to devote an aeon or more to offering them flowers, perfumes, banners, and standards,
while playing drums and music.That being done, what do you think, prince of gods?Would that
noble son or daughter receive much merit as a consequence of such activities?"

Śakra, the prince of gods, replied, "Many merits, Lord! Many merits, O Sugata!Were one to spend
hundreds of thousands of millions of aeons, it would be impossible to measure the limit
of the mass of merits that that noble son or daughter would thereby gather!"
