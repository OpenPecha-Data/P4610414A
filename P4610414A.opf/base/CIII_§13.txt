Elder Mahākāśyapa, if, equipoised in the eight liberations without transcending the eight perversionsyou
can enter the equanimity of reality by means of the equanimity of perversionand
if you can make a gift to all living beings and an offering to all the saints and Buddhas
out of even a single measure of alms, then you yourself may eat.Thus, when you eat, after
offering, you should be neither affected by passions nor free of passionsneither involved
in concentration nor free from concentrationneither living in the world nor abiding in
liberation.Furthermore, those who give such alms, reverend, have neither great merit nor small
meritneither gain nor loss.They should follow the way of the Buddhas, not the way of
the disciples.Only in this way, Elder Mahākāśyapa, is the practice of eating by alms meaningful.
