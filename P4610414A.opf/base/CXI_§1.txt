Thereupon, the Buddha said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti,"Noble son, when you would see the Tathāgata,how
do you view him?"

Thus addressed, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the Buddha,"Lord, when I would see the Tathāgata,I
view him by not seeing any Tathāgata.Why?I see him as not born from the past, not
passing on to the future, and not abiding in the present time.Why?He is the essence which
is the reality of matter, but he is not matter.He is the essence which is the reality of sensation,
but he is not sensation.He is the essence which is the reality of intellect, but
he is not intellect.He is the essence which is the reality of motivation, yet he is not motivation.He
is the essence which is the reality of consciousness, yet he is not consciousness.Like
the element of space, he does not abide in any of the four elements.Transcending
the scope of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, he is not produced in the six sense-media.He
is not involved in the three worlds,is free of the three defilements,is associated
with the triple liberation,is endowed with the three knowledges,and has truly attained the
unattainable."The Tathāgata has reached the extreme of detachment in regard to all things,
yet he is not a reality-limit.He abides in ultimate reality, yet there is no relationship
between it and him.He is not produced from causes, nor does he depend on conditions.He
is not without any characteristic, nor has he any characteristic.He has no single nature
nor any diversity of natures.

He is not a conception, not a mental construction, nor is he a nonconception.He is neither the
other shore, nor this shore, nor that between.He is neither here, nor there, nor anywhere
else. He is neither this nor that.He cannot be discovered by consciousness, nor is he inherent
in consciousness.He is neither darkness nor light.He is neither name nor sign.He is
neither weak nor strong.He lives in no country or direction.He is neither good nor evil.He
is neither compounded nor uncompounded.

He cannot be explained as having any meaning whatsoever."The Tathāgata is neither generosity
nor avarice,neither morality nor immorality,neither tolerance nor malice,neither effort nor
sloth,neither concentration nor distraction,neither wisdom nor foolishness.He is inexpressible.He
is neither truth nor falsehood;neither escape from the world nor failure to escape
from the world;

neither cause of involvement in the world nor not a cause of involvement in the world;he is
the cessation of all theory and all practice.He is neither a field of merit nor not a field
of merit;he is neither worthy of offerings nor unworthy of offerings.He is not an object,
and cannot be contacted.He is not a whole, nor a conglomeration.He surpasses all calculations.He
is utterly unequaled,yet equal to the ultimate reality of things.He is matchless,
especially in effort.He surpasses all measure.He does not go, does not stay,does not pass
beyond.He is neither seen, heard, distinguished, nor known.He is without any complexity,having
attained the equanimity of omniscient gnosis.Equal toward all things,he does not discriminate
between them.He is without reproach, without excess, without corruption, without
conception, and without intellectualization.He is without activity, without birth, without
occurrence, without origin, without production, and without nonproduction.He is without
fear and without subconsciousness; without sorrow,without joy, and without strain.No verbal
teaching can express him.

"Such is the body of the Tathāgataand thus should he be seen.Who sees thus, truly sees.Who sees
otherwise, sees falsely."
