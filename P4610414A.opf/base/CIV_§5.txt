"Good sir, is your condition tolerable? Is it livable? Are your physical elements not disturbed?Is
your sickness diminishing? Is it not increasing?The Buddha asks about you - if you
have slight trouble,slight discomfort, slight sickness, if your distress is light, if you
are cared for, strong, at ease, without self-reproach, and if you are living in touch with
the supreme happiness.
