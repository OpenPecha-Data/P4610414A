Then the Lord Śākyamuni said to the bodhisattva Maitreya, the great spiritual hero,"I transmit
to you, Maitreya, this unexcelled, perfect enlightenment which I attained only after innumerable
millions of billions of aeons,in order that, at a later time, during a later life,
a similar teaching of the Dharma, protected by your supernatural power, will spread in
the world and will not disappear.Why?Maitreya, in the future there will be noble sons and
daughters, devas, nagas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and asuras, who, having planted the roots of
virtue, will produce the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.If they do not hear this
teaching of the Dharma, they will certainly lose boundless advantages and even perish.But
if they hear such a teaching, they will rejoice, will believe, and will accept it upon
the crowns of their heads.Hence, in order to protect those future noble sons and daughters,
you must spread a teaching such as this!
