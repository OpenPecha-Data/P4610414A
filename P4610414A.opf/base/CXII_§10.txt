"The Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja said,’Noble son, the Dharma-worship is that worship rendered to
the discourses taught by the Tathāgata. These discourses are deep and profound in illumination.They
do not conform to the mundane and are difficult to understand, difficult to see
and difficult to realize. They are subtle, precise, and ultimately incomprehensible.As Scriptures,
they are collected in the canon of the bodhisattvas, stamped with the insignia of
the king of incantations and teachings.They reveal the irreversible wheel of Dharma,arising
from the six transcendences,cleansed of any false notions.They are endowed with all the
aids to enlightenment and embody the seven factors of enlightenment.They introduce living
beings to the great compassion and teach them the great love.They eliminate all the convictions
of the Māras, and they manifest relativity.
