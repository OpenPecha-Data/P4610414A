The bodhisattva Candrottara declared,"’Darkness’ and ’light’ are dualistic,but the absence of
both darkness and light is nonduality.Why?At the time of absorption in cessation, there
is neither darkness nor light,and likewise with the natures of all things.The entrance into
this equanimity is the entrance into nonduality."
