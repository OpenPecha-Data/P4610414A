No one abides in, or regresses from, enlightenment.Maitreya, you should introduce these deities
to the repudiation of all discriminative constructions concerning enlightenment.

"’Enlightenment is perfectly realized neither by the body nor by the mind.Enlightenment is the
eradication of all marks.Enlightenment is free of presumptions concerning all objects.Enlightenment
is free of the functioning of all intentional thoughts.Enlightenment is the annihilation
of all convictions.Enlightenment is free from all discriminative constructions.Enlightenment
is free from all vacillation, mentation, and agitation.Enlightenment is not
involved in any commitments.Enlightenment is the arrival at detachment, through freedom from
all habitual attitudes.The ground of enlightenment is the ultimate realm.Enlightenment
is realization of reality.Enlightenment abides at the limit of reality.Enlightenment is without
duality, since therein are no minds and no things.Enlightenment is equality, since
it is equal to infinite space. "’Enlightenment is unconstructed, because it is neither born
nor destroyed, neither abides nor undergoes any transformation.Enlightenment is the complete
knowledge of the thoughts, deeds, and inclinations of all living beings.Enlightenment
is not a door for the six media of sense.Enlightenment is unadulterated, since it is free
of the passions of the instinctually driven succession of lives.Enlightenment is neither
somewhere nor nowhere, abiding in no location or dimension.Enlightenment, not being contained
in anything, does not stand in reality.Enlightenment is merely a name and even that name
is unmoving.Enlightenment, free of abstention and undertaking, is energyless.There is no
agitation in enlightenment, as it is utterly pure by nature.Enlightenment is radiance, pure
in essence.Enlightenment is without subjectivity and completely without object.Enlightenment,
which penetrates the equality of all things, is undifferentiated.Enlightenment, which
is not shown by any example, is incomparable.Enlightenment is subtle, since it is extremely
difficult to realize.Enlightenment is all-pervasive, as it has the nature of infinite
space.Enlightenment cannot be realized, either physically or mentally.Why? The body is like
grass, trees, walls, paths, and hallucinations. And the mind is immaterial, invisible,
baseless, and unconscious.’
