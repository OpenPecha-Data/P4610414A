When I had heard these words, I wondered if I had previously misheard and misunderstood the
Buddha, and I was very much ashamed.Then I heard a voice from the sky: Ānanda! The householder
speaks to you truly.

Nevertheless, since the Buddha has appeared during the time of the five corruptions, he disciplines
living beings by acting lowly and humble.Therefore, Ānanda, do not be ashamed, and
go and get the milk!
