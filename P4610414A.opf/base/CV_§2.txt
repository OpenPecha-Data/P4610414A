Śāriputra replied, "I came for the sake of the Dharma, not for the sake of a chair."Vimalakīrti
continued, "Reverend Śāriputra, he who is interested in the Dharma is not interested even
in his own body,much less in a chair.Reverend Śāriputra, he who is interested in the Dharma
has no interest in matter, sensation, intellect, motivation, or consciousness.He has
no interest in these aggregates, or in the elements, or in the sense-media.Interested in
the Dharma, he has no interest in the realm of desire, the realm of matter, or the immaterial
realm.Interested in the Dharma, he is not interested in attachment to the Buddha, attachment
to the Dharma, or attachment to the Sangha.
