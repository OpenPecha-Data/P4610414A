Śāriputra:Excellent! Excellent, goddess! Pray, what have you attained, what have you realized,
that you have such eloquence?

Goddess: I have attained nothing, reverend Śāriputra. I have no realization.Therefore I have
such eloquence.Whoever thinks, "I have attained! I have realized!"is overly proud in the
discipline of the well-taught Dharma.
