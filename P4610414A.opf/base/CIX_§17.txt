Why?Good sirs, in this Sahā universe, there are ten virtuous practiceswhich do not exist in
any other buddha-field.What are these ten?Here they are: to win the poor by generosity;to
win the immoral by morality;to win the hateful by means of tolerance;to win the lazy by means
of effort;to win the mentally troubled by means of concentration;to win the falsely wise
by means of true wisdom;to show those suffering from the eight adversities how to rise
above them;to teach the Mahāyāna to those of narrow-minded behavior;to win those who have
not produced the roots of virtue by means of the roots of virtue;and to develop living beings
without interruption through the four means of unification.Those who engage in these ten
virtuous practices do not exist in any other buddha-field."
