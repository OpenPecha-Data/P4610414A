Among them, there was a prince by the name of Candracchattra,who retired into solitude and thought
to himself,’Is there not another mode of worship, even better and more noble than this?’

"Then, by the supernatural power of the Buddha Bhaiṣajyarāja, the gods spoke to him from the
heavens:’Good man, the supreme worship is the Dharma-worship.’

"Candracchattra asked them, ’What is this "Dharma-worship"?’ "

The gods replied, ’Good man, go to the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja, ask him about the "Dharma-worship,"and
he will explain it to you fully.’

"Then, the prince Candracchattra went to the Lord Bhaiṣajyarāja, the saint, the Tathāgata, the
insuperably, perfectly enlightened one,and having approached him, bowed down at his feet,circumambulated
him to the right three times, and withdrew to one side. He then asked,’Lord,
I have heard of a "Dharma-worship," which surpasses all other worship. What it this "Dharma-worship"?’
