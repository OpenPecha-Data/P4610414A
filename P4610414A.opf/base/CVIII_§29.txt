The bodhisattva Ratnamudrāhasta declared,"It is dualistic to detest the world and to rejoice
in liberation,and neither detesting the world nor rejoicing in liberation is nonduality.Why?Liberation
can be found where there is bondage,but where there is ultimately no bondage
where is there need for liberation?The mendicant who is neither bound nor liberated does
not experience any like or any dislike and thus he enters nonduality."
