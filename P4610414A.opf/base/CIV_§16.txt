"What is bondage? And what is liberation?To indulge in liberation from the world without employing
liberative technique is bondage for the bodhisattva.To engage in life in the world
with full employment of liberative technique is liberation for the bodhisattva.To experience
the taste of contemplation, meditation, and concentration without skill in liberative technique
is bondage.To experience the taste of contemplation and meditation with skill in
liberative technique is liberation.Wisdom not integrated with liberative technique is bondage,but
wisdom integrated with liberative technique is liberation.Liberative technique not
integrated with wisdom is bondage,but liberative technique integrated with wisdom is liberation.
