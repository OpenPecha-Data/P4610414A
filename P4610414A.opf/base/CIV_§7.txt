For example, Mañjuśrī, when the only son of a merchant is sick,both his parents become sick
on account of the sickness of their son.And the parents will suffer as long as that only son
does not recover from his sickness.Just so, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisattva loves all living
beings as if each were his only child.He becomes sick when they are sick and is cured when
they are cured.You ask me, Mañjuśrī, whence comes my sickness;the sicknesses of the bodhisattvas
arise from great compassion."
