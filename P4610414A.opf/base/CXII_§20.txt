Thus having been taught, the bodhisattva Maitreya said to the Buddha,"Lord, the beautiful teachings
of the Tathāgata are wonderful and truly excellent.Lord, from this time forth, I will
avoid all such errorsand will defend and uphold this attainment of unexcelled, perfect
enlightenment by the Tathāgata during innumerable hundreds of thousands of millions of billions
of aeons!In the future, I will place in the hands of noble sons and noble daughters
who are worthy vessels of the holy Dharma this profound teaching.I will instill in them the
power of memory with which they may, having believed in this teaching, retain it, recite,
it, penetrate its depths, teach it, propagate it, write it down,and proclaim it extensively
to others."Thus I will instruct them,Lord, and thus it may be known that in that future
time those who believe in this teaching and who enter deeply into itwill be sustained by
the supernatural blessing of the bodhisattva Maitreya."

Thereupon the Buddha gave his approval to the bodhisattva Maitreya:"Excellent! Excellent! Your
word is well given!The Tathāgata rejoices and commends your good promise."
