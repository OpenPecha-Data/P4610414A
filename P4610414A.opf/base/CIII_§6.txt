Reverend Maudgalyāyana, that is not the way to teach the Dharma to the householders in their
white clothes.The Dharma must be taught according to reality.Reverend Maudgalyāyana, the
Dharma is without living beings, because it is free of the dust of living beings.It is selfless,
because it is free of the dust of desire.It is lifeless, because it is free of birth
and death.It is without personalities, because it dispenses with past origins and future
destinies.The Dharma is peace and pacification, because it is free from desire.It does not
become an objectbecause it is free of words and letters;it is inexpressible, and it transcends
all movement of mind.The Dharma is omnipresent, because it is like infinite space.It
is without color, mark, or shape, because it is free of all process.It is without the concept
of mine, because it is free of the habitual notion of possession.It is without ideation,
because it is free of mind, thought, or consciousness.It is incomparable, because it
has no antitheses.It is without presumption of conditionality, because it does not conform
to causes.It permeates evenly all things, because all are included in the ultimate realm.It
conforms to reality by means of the process of nonconformity.It abides at the reality-limit,
for it is utterly without fluctuation.It is immovable, because it is independent of
the six objects of sense.It is without coming and going, for it never stands still.It is comprised
by voidness, is remarkable through signlessness, and is free of presumption and repudiation,
because of wishlessness.It is without establishment and rejection, without birth
or destruction.It is without any fundamental consciousness, transcending the range of eye,
ear, nose, tongue, body, and thought.It is without highness and lowness. It abides without
movement or activity.
