Then, those bodhisattvas, having heard this teaching, were satisfied, delighted, and reverent.
They were filled with rejoicing and happiness of mind.In order to worship the Buddha Śākyamuni
and the bodhisattvas of the Sahā universe, as well as this teaching, they covered
the whole earth of this billion-world universe with fragrant powder, incense, perfumes, and
flowers up to the height of the knees.Having thus regaled the whole retinue of the Tathāgata,
bowed their heads at the feet of the Buddha, and circumambulated him to the right three
times, they sang a hymn of praise to him.They then disappeared from this universe and
in a split second were back in the universe Sarvagandhasugandhā.
