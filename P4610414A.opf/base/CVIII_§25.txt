The bodhisattva Puṇyakṣetra declared,"It is dualistic to consider actions meritorious, sinful,
or neutral.The non-undertaking of meritorious, sinful, and neutral actions is not dualistic.The
intrinsic nature of all such actions is voidness,wherein ultimately there is neither
merit, nor sin, nor neutrality, nor action itself.The nonaccomplishment of such actions
is the entrance into nonduality."
