"Such a bodhisattva can pick up with his right hand this billion-world-galactic universe as
if it were a potterâ€™s wheel and, spinning it round, throw it beyond universes as numerous
as the sands of the Ganges,without the living beings therein knowing their motion or its origin,and
he can catch it and put it back in its place,without the living beings suspecting
their coming and going;and yet the whole operation is visible.
