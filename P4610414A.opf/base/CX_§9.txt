Similarly, Ānanda, there are buddha-fields that accomplish the buddha-work by means of teaching
living beings words, definitions, and examples, such as ’dreams,’ ’images,’ ’the reflection
of the moon in water,’ ’echoes,’ ’illusions,’ and ’mirages’;and those that accomplish
the buddha-work by making words understandable.Also, Ānanda, there are utterly pure buddha-fields
that accomplish the buddha-work for living beings without speech, by silence, inexpressibility,
and unteachability.
