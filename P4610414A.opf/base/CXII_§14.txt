Then, prince of gods, the prince Candracchattra, out of his great faith in the Tathāgata, left
the household life in order to enter the homeless life of a monkHaving made great effort
and being well established in virtue, he soon produced the five superknowledges,understood
the incantations, and obtained the invincible eloquence.When the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja
attained ultimate liberation, Candracchattra, on the strength of his superknowledges and
by the power of his incantations, made the wheel of the Dharma turn just as the Tathāgata
Bhaiṣajyarāja had done and continued to do so for ten short aeons."Prince of gods, while
the monk Candracchattra was exerting himself thus to protect the holy Dharma, thousands of
millions of living beings reached the stage of irreversibility on the path to unexcelled,
perfect enlightenment,fourteen billion living beings were disciplined in the vehicles of
the disciples and solitary sages,and innumerable living beings took rebirth in the human and
heavenly realms.
