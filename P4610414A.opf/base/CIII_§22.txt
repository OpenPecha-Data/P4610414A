Reverend Pūrṇa, first concentrate yourself, regard the minds of these young bhikshus, and then
teach them the Dharma!Do not put rotten food into a jeweled bowl!First understand the inclinations
of these monksand do not confuse priceless sapphires with glass beads!Reverend
Pūrṇa, without examining the spiritual faculties of living beings, do not presume upon the
one-sidedness of their faculties;do not wound those who are without wounds;do not impose
a narrow path upon those who aspire to a great path;do not try to pour the great ocean into
the hoof-print of an ox;do not try to put Mount Sumeru into a grain of mustard;do not confuse
the brilliance of the sun with the light of a glowworm;and do not expose those who
admire the roar of a lion to the howl of a jackal!Reverend Pūrṇa, all these monks were formerly
engaged in the Mahāyāna but have forgotten the spirit of enlightenment.Do not, therefore,
O Hoonourable Pūrṇa, teach them the Listeners Vehicle. The Listeners Vehicle is shallow.So
do not instruct them in the disciple-vehicle. The disciple-vehicle is not ultimately
valid, and you disciples are like men blind from birth, in regard to recognition of the
degrees of the spiritual faculties of living beings.
