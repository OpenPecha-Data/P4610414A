The bodhisattvas exclaimed,"How great must that bodhisattva be himself if his magical incarnation
is thus endowed with supernatural power, strength, and fearlessness!"

The Tathāgata said,"The greatness of that bodhisattva is such that he sends magical incarnations
to all the buddha-fields of the ten directions,and all these incarnations accomplish
the buddha-work for all the living beings in all those buddha-fields."
