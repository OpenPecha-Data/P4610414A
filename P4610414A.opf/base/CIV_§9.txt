Mañjuśrī: Householder, of what sort is your sickness?

Vimalakīrti: It is immaterial and invisible.

Mañjuśrī: Is it physical or mental?

Vimalakīrti: It is not physical, since the body is insubstantial in itself.It is not mental,
since the nature of the mind is like illusion.

Mañjuśrī: Householder, which of the four main elements is disturbed - earth, water, fire, or
air?

Vimalakīrti:Mañjuśrī, I am sick only because the elements of living beings are disturbed by
sicknesses.
