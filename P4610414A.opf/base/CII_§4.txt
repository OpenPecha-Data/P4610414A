In order to be in harmony with people, he associated with elders, with those of middle age,
and with the young, yet always spoke in harmony with the Dharma.

He engaged in all sorts of businesses, yet had no interest in profit or possessions.

To train living beings, he would appear at crossroads and on street corners, and to protect
them he participated in government.

To turn people away from the H카nay훮na and to engage them in the Mah훮y훮na, he appeared among
listeners and teachers of the Dharma.

To develop children, he visited all the schools.

To demonstrate the evils of desire, he even entered the brothels.

To establish drunkards in correct mindfulness, he entered all the cabarets.
