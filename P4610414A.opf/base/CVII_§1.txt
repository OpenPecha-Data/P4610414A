Then, the crown prince Mañjuśrī said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti,"Noble sir, how does the bodhisattva
follow the way to attain the qualities of the Buddha?"

Vimalakīrti replied, "Mañjuśrī, when the bodhisattva follows the wrong way, he follows the way
to attain the qualities of the Buddha."

Mañjuśrī continued, "How does the bodhisattva follow the wrong way?"

Vimalakīrti replied, "Even should he enact the five deadly sins,he feels no malice, violence,
or hate.Even should he go into the hells,he remains free of all taint of passions.Even should
he go into the states of the animals,he remains free of darkness and ignorance.When
he goes into the states of the asuras,he remains free of pride, conceit, and arrogance.When
he goes into the realm of the lord of death,he accumulates the stores of merit and wisdom.When
he goes into the states of motionlessness and immateriality,he does not dissolve therein."He
may follow the ways of desire,yet he stays free of attachment to the enjoyments
of desire.He may follow the ways of hatred,yet he feels no anger to any living being.He may
follow the ways of folly,yet he is ever conscious with the wisdom of firm understanding.
"He may follow the ways of avarice,yet he gives away all internal and external things without
regard even for his own life.He may follow the ways of immorality,yet, seeing the horror
of even the slightest transgressions, he lives by the ascetic practices and austerities.He
may follow the ways of wickedness and anger,yet he remains utterly free of malice and
lives by love.He may follow the ways of laziness,yet his efforts are uninterrupted as he
strives in the cultivation of roots of virtue.He may follow the ways of sensuous distraction,yet,
naturally concentrated, his contemplation is not dissipated.He may follow the ways
of false wisdom,yet, having reached the transcendence of wisdom, he is expert in all mundane
and transcendental sciences. "He may show the ways of sophistry and contention,yet he
is always conscious of ultimate meanings and has perfected the use of liberative techniques.He
may show the ways of pride,yet he serves as a bridge and a ladder for all people.He may
show the ways of the passions,yet he is utterly dispassionate and naturally pure.He may
follow the ways of the Māras,yet he does not really accept their authority in regard to his
knowledge of the qualities of the Buddha.He may follow the ways of the disciples,yet he
lets living beings hear the teaching they have not heard before.He may follow the ways of
the solitary sages,yet he is inspired with great compassion in order to develop all living
beings. "He may follow the ways of the poor,yet he holds in his hand a jewel of inexhaustible
wealth.He may follow the ways of cripples,yet he is beautiful and well adorned with
the auspicious signs and marks.He may follow the ways of those of lowly birth,yet, through
his accumulation of the stores of merit and wisdom, he is born in the family of the Tathāgatas.He
may follow the ways of the weak, the ugly, and the wretched,yet he is beautiful to
look upon, and his body is like that of Narayana."He may manifest to living beings the ways
of the sick and the unhappy,yet he has entirely conquered and transcended the fear of
death. "He may follow the ways of the rich,yet he is without acquisitiveness and often reflects
upon the notion of impermanence.He may show himself engaged in dancing with harem girls,yet
he cleaves to solitude, having crossed the swamp of desire. "He follows the ways of
the dumb and the incoherent,yet, having acquired the power of incantations, he is adorned
with a varied eloquence."He follows the ways of the heterodoxwithout ever becoming heterodox.He
follows the ways of all the world,yet he reverses all states of existence.He follows
the way of liberationwithout ever abandoning the progress of the world."Mañjuśrī, thus
does the bodhisattva follow the wrong ways,thereby following the way to the qualities of the
Buddha."
