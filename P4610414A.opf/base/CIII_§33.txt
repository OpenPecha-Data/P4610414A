The Buddha then said to the venerable UpāliUpāli, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti to inquire
about his illness.

Upāli replied, Lord, I am indeed reluctant to go to that good man to inquire about his illness.Why?Lord,
I remember that one day there were two monks who had committed some infraction
and were too ashamed to appear before the Lordso they came to me and saidReverend Upāli,
we have both committed an infraction but are too ashamed to appear before the Buddha.Venerable
Upāli, kindly remove our anxieties by absolving us of these infractions.
