In that universe Abhirati, the disciples, bodhisattvas, and those among gods and men who possessed
the superknowledge of the divine eyeall cried out,"Lord, we are being carried away!
Sugata, we are being carried off!Protect us, O Tathāgata!"

But, to discipline them, the Tathāgata Akṣobhya said to them,"You are being carried off by the
bodhisattva Vimalakīrti. It is not my affair."

As for the other men and gods, they had no awareness at all that they were being carried anywhere.Although
the universe Abhirati had been brought into the universe Sahā, the Sahā universe
was not increased or diminished;it was neither compressed nor obstructed.Nor was the
universe Abhirati reduced internally,and both universes appeared to be the same as they had
ever been.
