"Reverend Śāriputra, I have shown you only a small part of the entrance into the domain of the
bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation.Reverend Śāriputra, to explain to
you the teaching of the full entrance into the domain of the bodhisattva who lives in the
inconceivable liberation would require more than an aeon, and even more than that."
