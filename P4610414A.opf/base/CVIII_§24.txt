The bodhisattva SuvinÄ«ta declared,"Physical, verbal, and mental vows do not exist dualistically.Why?These
things have the nature of inactivity.The nature of inactivity of the body is
the same as the nature of inactivity of speech, whose nature of inactivity is the same as
the nature of inactivity of the mind.It is necessary to know and to understand this fact
of the ultimate inactivity of all things,for this knowledge is the entrance into nonduality."
