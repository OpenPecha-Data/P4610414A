"Perhaps, prince of gods, you are wondering or experiencing some doubt about whether or not,
at that former time, the King Ratnacchattrawas not some other than the actual Tathāgata Ratnarcis.
You must not imagine that,for the present Tathāgata Ratnarcis was at that time,
in that epoch, the universal monarch Ratnacchattra.As for the thousand sons of the King Ratnacchattra,
they are now the thousand bodhisattvas of the present blessed aeon,during the
course of which one thousand Buddhas will appear in the world.Among them,Krakucchanda and
others are already born,and those remaining will still be born,from Kakutsunda up to the
Tathāgata Roca,who will be the last to be born.

"Perhaps, prince of gods, you are asking yourself if, in that life, in that time, the Prince
Candracchattra who upheld the Holy Dharma of Lord Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyarāja was not someone
other than myself.But you must not imagine that,for I was, in that life, in that time, the
Prince Candracchattra.Thus it is necessary to know, prince of gods,that among all the worships
rendered to the Tathāgata, the Dharma-worship is the very best.Yes, it is good, eminent,
excellent, perfect, supreme, and unexcelled.And therefore, prince of gods, do not worship
me with material objects but worship me with the Dharma-worship! Do not honor me with
material objects but honor me by honor to the Dharma!"
