"’Therefore, Maitreya, is your reality from birth? Or is it from cessation?Your reality as prophesied
is not born and does not cease, nor will it be born nor will it cease.(Furthermore,
your reality is just the same as) the reality of all living beings, the reality of all
things,and the reality of all the holy ones.Furthermore, your reality is just the same as
(the reality of all living beings, the reality of all things, )If your enlightenment can
be prophesied in such a way, so can that of all living beings.Why?Because reality does not
consist of duality or of diversity.Maitreya, whenever you attain Buddhahood, which is the
perfection of enlightenment, at the same time all living beings will also attain Buddhahood.Why?Enlightenment
consists of the realization of all living beings.Maitreya, at the moment
when you attain ultimate liberation, all living beings will also attain ultimate liberation.Why?The
Tathāgatas do not enter ultimate liberation until all living beings have entered
ultimate liberation.For, since all living beings are utterly liberated, the Tathāgatas
see them as having the nature of ultimate liberation."’Therefore, Maitreya, do not fool
and delude these deities!
