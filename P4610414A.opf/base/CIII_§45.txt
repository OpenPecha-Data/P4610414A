Reverend Ānanda, the Tathāgatas have the body of the Dharma - not a body that is sustained by
material food.The Tathāgatas have a transcendental body that has transcended all mundane
qualities.There is no injury to the body of a Tathāgata, as it is rid of all defilements.The
body of a Tathāgata is uncompounded and free of all formative activity.Reverend Ānanda,
to believe there can be illness in such a body is irrational and unseemly!
