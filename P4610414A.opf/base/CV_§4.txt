The Dharma is not a secure refuge.He who enjoys a secure refuge is not interested in the Dharma
but is interested in a secure refuge.The Dharma is without sign.He whose consciousness
pursues signs is not interested in the Dharma but is interested in signs.The Dharma is not
a society.He who seeks to associate with the Dharma is not interested in the Dharma but
is interested in association.The Dharma is not a sight, a sound, a category, or an idea.He
who is involved in sights, sounds, categories, and ideas is not interested in the Dharma
but is interested in sights, sounds, categories, and ideas.
