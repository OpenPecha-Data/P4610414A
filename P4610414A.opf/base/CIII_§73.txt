The Dharma-sacrifice consists of the store of merit which is consummated by the auspicious signs
and marks, the ornaments of the buddha-fields, and all other means of development of
living beings;of the store of knowledge which is consummated in the ability to teach the Dharma
according to the thoughts and actions of all living beings;of the store of wisdom, which
is consummated in the uniform gnosis free of acceptance and rejection in regard to all
things;of the store of all roots of virtue, consummated in the abandonment of all passions,
obscurations, and unvirtuous things;
