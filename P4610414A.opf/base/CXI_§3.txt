Then, the Buddha said to the venerable Śāriputra,"Śāriputra, this holy person came here from
the presence of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya in the universe Abhirati."

Śāriputra: Lord, it is wonderful that this holy person, having left a buddha-field as pure as
Abhirati, should enjoy a buddha-field as full of defects as this Sahā universe!

The Licchavi Vimalakīrti said, "Śāriputra, what do you think?Does the light of the sun accompany
the darkness?"Śāriputra: Certainly not, noble sir!Vimalakīrti: Then the two do not go
together?

Śāriputra: Noble sir, those two do not go together.As soon as the sun rises, all darkness is
destroyed.

Vimalakīrti: Then why does the sun rise over the world?

Śāriputra: It rises to illuminate the world, and to eliminate the darkness.

Vimalakīrti: Just in the same way, reverend Śāriputra, the bodhisattva reincarnates voluntarily
in the impure buddha-fields in order to purify the living beings, in order to make the
light of wisdom shine, and in order to clear away the darkness.Since they do not associate
with the passions, they dispel the darkness of the passions of all living beings.
