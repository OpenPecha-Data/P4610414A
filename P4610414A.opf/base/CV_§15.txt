He can take all the masses of fire of all the supernovas that ultimately consume all the universes
of all the buddha-fields into his stomachwithout interfering with their functions.Having
crossed buddha-fields as numerous as the sands of the Ganges downward,and having taken
up a buddha-field, he can rise up through buddha-fields as numerous as the sands of the
Ganges and place it on high,just as a strong man may pick up a jujube leaf on the point of
a needle.
