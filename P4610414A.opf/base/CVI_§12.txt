Nevertheless, reverend Śāriputra, just as one cannot smell the castor plant in a magnolia wood,
but only the magnolia flowers,so, reverend Śāriputra, living in this house, which is redolent
with the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, one does not smell the perfume
of the disciples and the solitary sages.Reverend Śāriputra, the Sakras, the Brahmās,
the Lokapālas, the devas, nagas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas
who live in this househear the Dharma from the mouth of this holy man and, enticed by
the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, proceed to conceive the spirit of enlightenment.Reverend
Śāriputra, I have been in this house for twelve years, and I have heard
no discourses concerning the disciples and solitary sages but have heard only those concerning
the great love, the great compassion, and the inconceivable qualities of the Buddha.
