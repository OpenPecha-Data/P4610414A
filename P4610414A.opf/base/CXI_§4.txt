Thereupon, the entire multitude experienced the desireto behold the universe Abhirati, the Tathāgata
Akṣobhya, his bodhisattvas, and his great disciples.

The Buddha, knowing the thoughts of the entire multitude,said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti,"Noble
son, this multitude wishes to behold the universe Abhirati and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya
-show them!"

Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti thought,"Without rising from my couch,I shall pick up in my right
hand the universe Abhirati and all it contains:its hundreds of thousands of bodhisattvas;
its abodes of devas, nagas, yakṣas, gandharvas, and asuras,bounded by its Cakravada mountains;
its rivers, lakes, fountains, streams, oceans, and other bodies of water;its Mount
Sumeru and other hills and mountain ranges;its moon, its sun, and its stars;its devas, nagas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, and asuras themselves; its Brahmā and his retinues;its villages,
cities, towns, provinces, kingdoms, men, women, and houses;its bodhisattvas; its disciples;the
tree of enlightenment of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya;and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya himself,
seated in the middle of an assembly vast as an ocean, teaching the Dharma.Also the lotuses
that accomplish the buddha-work among the living beings;the three jeweled ladders that rise
from its earth to its Trayastriṃśā heaven,on which ladders the gods of that heaven descend
to the world to see, honor, and serve the Tathāgata Akṣobhya and to hear the Dharma,and
on which the men of the earth climb to the Trayastriṃśā heaven to visit those gods.(Like
a potter with his wheel), I will reduce that universe Abhirati, with its store of innumerable
virtues, from its watery base up to its Akanistha heaven, to a minute sizeand, carrying
it gently like a garland of flowers, will bring it to this Sahā universeand will show it
to the multitudes."
