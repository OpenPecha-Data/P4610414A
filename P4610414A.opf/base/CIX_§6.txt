At that the bodhisattvas of the buddha-field of the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa were astonished and
asked the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa,"Lord, where is there such a great being as this?Where
is the universe Sahā?What does he mean by ’those who aspire to inferior ways’?"Having thus
been questioned by those bodhisattvas,

the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa said,"Noble sons, the universe Sahā exists beyond as many buddha-fields
in the direction of the nadir as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers.There the
Tathāgata Śākyamuni teaches the Dharma to living beings who aspire to the inferior ways,
in that buddha-field tainted with five corruptions.There the bodhisattva Vimalakīrti, who
lives in the inconceivable liberation, teaches the Dharma to the bodhisattvas.He sends this
incarnation-bodhisattva here in order to celebrate my name, in order to show the advantages
of this universe, and in order to increase the roots of virtue of those bodhisattvas."
