The bodhisattva Nārāyana declared,"To say, ’This is mundane’ and ’That is transcendental’ is
dualism.This world has the nature of voidness,so there is neither transcendence nor involvement,
neither progress nor standstill.Thus, neither to transcend nor to be involved, neither
to go nor to stop -this is the entrance into nonduality."
