Reverend Mahamaud galyayana, how could there be a teaching in regard to such a Dharma?Reverend
Mahamaud galyayana, even the expression to teach the Dharma is presumptuousand those who
listen to it listen to presumption.Reverend Maudgalyāyana, where there are no presumptuous
words, there is no teacher of the Dharma, no one to listen, and no one to understand.It
is as if an illusory person were to teach the Dharma to illusory people.
