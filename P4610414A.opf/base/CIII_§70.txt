The Dharma-sacrifice consists of the transcendence of generosity, which is consummated in peacefulness
and self-discipline;of the transcendence of morality, which is consummated in the
moral development of immoral beings;of the transcendence of tolerance, consummated through
the principle of selflessness;of the transcendence of effort, consummated in initiative
toward enlightenment;of the transcendence of meditation, consummated in the solitude of
body and mind;and of the transcendence of wisdom, consummated in the omniscient gnosis. "â€™
