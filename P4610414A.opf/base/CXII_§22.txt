Then the four Mahārājas, the great kings of the quarters, said to the Buddha,"Lord, in all the
towns, villages, cities, kingdoms, and palaces, wherever this discourse of the Dharma will
be practised, upheld, and correctly taught,we, the four great kings, will go there with
our armies, our young warriors, and our retinues, to hear the Dharma.And we will protect
the teachers of this Dharma for a radius of one leagueso that no one who plots injury or
disruption against these teachers will have any opportunity to do them harm."
