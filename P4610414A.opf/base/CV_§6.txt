Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the crown prince, Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, you have already
been in innumerable hundreds of thousands of buddha-fields throughout the universes of the
ten directions.In which buddha-field did you see the best lion-thrones with the finest
qualities?"Mañjuśrī replied,"Noble sir, if one crosses the buddha-fields to the east, which
are more numerous than all the grains of sand of thirty-two Ganges rivers, one will discover
a universe called Merudhvaja.There dwells a Tathāgata called Merupradīparāja.His body
measures eighty-four hundred thousand leagues in height,and the height of his throne is sixty-eight
hundred thousand leagues.The bodhisattvas there are forty-two hundred thousand
leagues talland their own thrones are thirty-four hundred thousand leagues high.Noble sir,
the finest and most superb thrones exist in that universe Merudhvaja, which is the buddha-field
of the Tathāgata Merupradīparāja."
