"The sick bodhisattva should tell himself:’Just as my sickness is unreal and nonexistent,so
the sicknesses of all living beings are unreal and nonexistent.’Through such considerations,
he arouses the great compassion toward all living beings without falling into any sentimental
compassion.The great compassion that strives to eliminate the accidental passions does
not conceive of any life in living beings.Why?Because great compassion that falls into
sentimentally purposive views only exhausts the bodhisattva in his reincarnations.But the
great compassion which is free of involvement with sentimentally purposive views does not
exhaust the bodhisattva in all his reincarnations.He does not reincarnate through involvement
with such views but reincarnates with his mind free of involvement.Hence, even his reincarnation
is like a liberation.Being reincarnated as if being liberated, he has the power
and ability to teach the Dharma which liberates living beings from their bondage.As the
Lord declares: ’It is not possible for one who is himself bound to deliver others from their
bondage.But one who is himself liberated is able to liberate others from their bondage.’Therefore,
the bodhisattva should participate in liberation and should not participate in
bondage.
