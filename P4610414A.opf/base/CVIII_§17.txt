The bodhisattva Priyadar≈õana declared,"Matter itself is void.Voidness does not result from the
destruction of matter,but the nature of matter is itself voidness.Therefore, to speak of
voidness on the one hand, and of matter, or of sensation, or of intellect, or of motivation,
or of consciousness on the other - is entirely dualistic.Consciousness itself is voidness.Voidness
does not result from the destruction of consciousness,but the nature of consciousness
is itself voidness.Such understanding of the five compulsive aggregates and the
knowledge of themas such by means of gnosis is the entrance into nonduality."
