The Buddha said,"Have faith, prince of gods, and understand this:Whoever accepts this exposition
of the Dharma called ’Instruction in the Inconceivable Liberation,’ recites it, and understands
it deeply, he or she will gather merits even greater than those who perform the
above acts.Why so?Because, prince of gods, the enlightenment of the Buddhas arises from the
Dharma,and one honors them by the Dharma worship, and not by material worship.Thus it is
taught, prince of gods, and thus you must understand it."
