Mañjuśrī: Householder, how should a bodhisattva console another bodhisattva who is sick?

Vimalakīrti: He should tell him that the body is impermanent, but should not exhort him to renunciation
or disgust.He should tell him that the body is miserable, but should not encourage
him to find solace in liberation;that the body is selfless, but that living beings should
be developed;that the body is peaceful, but not to seek any ultimate calm.He should urge
him to confess his evil deeds, but not for the sake of absolution.He should encourage
his empathy for all living beings on account of his own sickness,his remembrance of suffering
experienced from beginningless time,and his consciousness of working for the welfare of
living beings.He should encourage him not to be distressed, but to manifest the roots of
virtue,to maintain the primal purityand the lack of craving,and thus to always strive tobecome
the king of healers, who can cure all sicknesses.Thus should a bodhisattva console a
sick bodhisattva, in such a way as to make him happy.
