Reverend Ānanda, go in silence, and do not belittle the Lord.Do not say such things to others.It
would not be good for the powerful gods or for the bodhisattvas coming from the various
buddha-fields to hear such words.Reverend Ānanda, a universal monarch, who is endowed only
with a small root of virtue, is free of diseases.How then could the Lord, who has an infinite
root of virtue, have any disease? It is impossible.Reverend Ānanda, do not bring shame
upon us, but go in silencelest the heterodox sectarians should hear your words. They
would sayFor shame! The teacher of these people cannot even cure his own sicknesses.How then
can he cure the sicknesses of others?Reverend Ānanda, go then discreetly so that no one
observes you.
