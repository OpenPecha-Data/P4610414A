"Ānanda, all the Buddhas are the same as to the perfection of the Buddha-qualities, that is:
their forms, their colors, their radiance, their bodies, their marks, their nobility,their
morality, their concentration, their wisdom, their liberation, the gnosis and vision of
liberation,their strengths, their fearlessnesses, their special Buddha-qualities,their great
love, their great compassion,their helpful intentions, their attitudes, their practices,
their paths, the lengths of their lives, their teachings of the Dharma, their development
and liberation of living beings,and their purification of buddha-fields.Therefore, they
are all called ’Samyakṣambuddhas,’’Tathāgatas,’and ’Buddhas.’

"Ānanda, were your life to last an entire aeon, it would not be easy for you to understand thoroughly
the extensive meaning and precise verbal significance of these three names.Also,
Ānanda, if all the living beings of this billion-world galactic universe were like you the
foremost of the learned and the foremost of those endowed with memory and incantations -and
were they to devote an entire aeon, they would still be unable to understand completely
the exact and extensive meaning of the three words ’ Samyakṣambuddha,’ ’Tathāgata,’ and
’Buddha.’Thus, Ānanda, the enlightenment of the Buddhas is immeasurable,and the wisdom and
the eloquence of the Tathāgatas are inconceivable."
