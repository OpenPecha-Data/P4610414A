Again the bodhisattvas asked,"How many qualities must a bodhisattva have, to go safe and sound
to a pure buddha-field after he transmigrates at death away from this Sahā universe?"

Vimalakīrti replied,"After he transmigrates at death away from this Sahā universe, a bodhisattva
must have eight qualities to reach a pure buddha-field safe and sound.What are the eight?He
must resolve to himself: ’I must benefit all living beings, without seeking even the
slightest benefit for myself.I must bear all the miseries of all living beings and give
all my accumulated roots of virtue to all living beings.I must have no resentment toward any
living being.I must rejoice in all bodhisattvas as if they were the Teacher.I must not
neglect any teachings, whether or not I have heard them before.I must control my mind, without
coveting the gains of others, and without taking pride in gains of my own.I must examine
my own faults and not blame others for their faults.I must take pleasure in being consciously
aware and must truly undertake all virtues.’"If a bodhisattva has these eight qualities,
when he transmigrates at death away from the Sahā universe, he will go safe and sound
to a pure buddha-field."

When the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and the crown prince Mañjuśrī had thus taught the Dharma to the
multitude gathered there, one hundred thousand living beings conceived the spirit of unexcelled,
perfect enlightenment,and ten thousand bodhisattvas attained the tolerance of the
birthlessness of things.
