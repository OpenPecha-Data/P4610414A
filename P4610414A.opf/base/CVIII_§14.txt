The bodhisattva Pratyakṣadarśana declared,"’Destructible’ and ’indestructible’ are dualistic.What
is destroyed is ultimately destroyed.What is ultimately destroyed does not become destroyed;hence,
it is called ’indestructible.’What is indestructible is instantaneous,and what
is instantaneous is indestructible.The experience of such is called ’the entrance into
the principle of nonduality.’"
