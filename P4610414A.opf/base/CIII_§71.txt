The Dharma-sacrifice consists of the meditation of voidness, consummated in effectiveness in
the development of all living beings;of the meditation of signlessness, consummated in the
purification of all compounded things;and of the meditation of wishlessness, consummated
in voluntarily assuming rebirths.
