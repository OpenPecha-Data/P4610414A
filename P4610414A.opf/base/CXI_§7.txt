Thereupon, the Buddha Śākyamuni asked all the multitudes,"Friends, behold the splendors of the
universe Abhirati, the Tathāgata Akṣobhya, the array of his buddha-field, and the splendors
of these disciples and bodhisattvas!"

They replied, "We see them, Lord!"

The Buddha said, "Those bodhisattvas who wish to embrace such a buddha-field should train themselves
in all the bodhisattva-practices of the Tathāgata Akṣobhya."

While Vimalakīrti, with his miraculous power, showed them thus the universe Abhirati and the
Tathāgata Akṣobhya,one hundred and forty thousand living beings among the men and gods of
the Sahā universe conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment,and all of them
formed a prayer to be reborn in the universe Abhirati.And the Buddha prophesied that in
the future all would be reborn in the universe Abhirati.And the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, having
thus developed all the living beings who could thereby be developed,returned the universe
Abhirati exactly to its former place.
