The Licchavi Vimalakīrti replied,"Reverend Śāriputra, for the Tathāgatas and the bodhisattvas,
there is a liberation called ’Inconceivable.’The bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable
liberation can put the king of mountains, Sumeru, which is so high, so great, so noble,
and so vast, into a mustard seed.He can perform this feat without enlarging the mustard
seed and without shrinking Mount Sumeru.And the deities of the assembly of the four Mahārājas
and of the Trayastriṃśā heavens do not even know where they are.Only those beings who
are destined to be disciplined by miracles see and understand the putting of the king of
mountains, Sumeru, into the mustard seed.That, reverend Śāriputra, is an entrance to the domain
of the inconceivable liberation of the bodhisattvas.
