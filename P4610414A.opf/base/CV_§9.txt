Then, the venerable Śāriputra said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti,"Noble sir, it is astonishing
that these thousands of thrones, so big and so high, should fit into such a small houseand
that the great city of Vaiśālī,the villages, cities, kingdoms, capitals of Jambudvīpa, the
other three continents, the abodes of the gods, the nagas, the yakṣas, the gandharvas,
the asuras, the garuḍas, the kiṃnaras, and the mahoragas - that all of these should appear
without any obstacle,just as they were before!"
