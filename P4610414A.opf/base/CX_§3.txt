The Buddha said to Śāriputra,"Śāriputra, did you see the miraculous performances of the bodhisattvas,
those best of beings?"

"I have seen them, Lord."

"What concept did you produce toward them?"

"Lord, I produced the concept of inconceivability toward them.Their activities appeared inconceivable
to me to the point that I was unable to think of them, to judge them, or even to
imagine them."
