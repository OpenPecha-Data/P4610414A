Then, the Buddha said to the crown prince, Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, go to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti
to inquire about his illness."

Mañjuśrī replied, "Lord, it is difficult to attend upon the Licchavi Vimalakīrti.He is gifted
with marvelous eloquence concerning the law of the profound.He is extremely skilled in full
expressions and in the reconciliation of dichotomies.His eloquence is inexorable,and no
one can resist his imperturbable intellect.He accomplishes all the activities of the bodhisattvas.He
penetrates all the secret mysteries of the bodhisattvas and the Buddhas.He is
skilled in civilizing all the abodes of devils. He plays with the great superknowledges.He
is consummate in wisdom and liberative technique.He has attained the supreme excellence
of the indivisible, nondual sphere of the ultimate realm.He is skilled in teaching the Dharma
with its infinite modalities within the uniform ultimate.He is skilled in granting means
of attainment in accordance with the spiritual faculties of all living beings.He has thoroughly
integrated his realization with skill in liberative technique.He has attained decisiveness
with regard to all questions.Thus, although he cannot be withstood by someone of
my feeble defenses,still, sustained by the grace of the Buddha, I will go to himand will
converse with him as well as I can."
