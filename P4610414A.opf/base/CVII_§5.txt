"Just as, for example, the five desire objects have no impression or effect on those bereft
of faculties,even so all the qualities of the Buddha have no impression or effect on the disciples,
who have abandoned all adherences.Thus, the disciples can never appreciate those
qualities."Therefore, Mañjuśrī, the ordinary individual is grateful to the Tathāgata,but
the disciples are not grateful.Why?The ordinary individuals, upon learning of the virtues
of the Buddha,conceive the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment, in order to insure
the uninterrupted continuity of the heritage of the Three Jewels;but the disciples, although
they may hear of the qualities, powers, and fearlessnesses of the Buddha until the end
of their days, are not capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment."
