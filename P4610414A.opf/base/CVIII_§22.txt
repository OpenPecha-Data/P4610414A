The bodhisattva Śāntendriya declared,"It is dualistic to say ’Buddha,’ ’Dharma,’ and ’Sangha.’The
Dharma is itself the nature of the Buddha, the Sangha is itself the nature of the Dharma,and
all of them are uncompounded.The uncompounded is infinite space,and the processes
of all things are equivalent to infinite space.Adjustment to this is the entrance into nonduality."
