Then, the Licchavi VimalakÄ«rti asked those bodhisattvas,"Good sirs, please explain how the bodhisattvas
enter the Dharma-door of nonduality!"

The bodhisattva Dharmavikurvanadeclared, "Noble sir, production and destruction are two,but
what is not produced and does not occur cannot be destroyed.Thus the attainment of the tolerance
of the birthlessness of things is the entrance into nonduality."
