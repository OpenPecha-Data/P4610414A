Lord, when I heard this teaching, I was astonished and thought: Reverence to all bodhisattvas!If
a lay bodhisattva may be endowed with such eloquence, who is there who would not conceive
the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment?From that time forth, I no longer recommend
the vehicles of the disciples and of the solitary sages but recommend the MahāyānaAnd
thus, Lord, I am reluctant to go to this good man to inquire about his illness.
