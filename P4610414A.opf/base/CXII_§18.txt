"Maitreya, there are two reasons the beginner bodhisattvas hurt themselves and do not concentrate
on the profound Dharma.What are they?Hearing this profound teaching never before heard,
they are terrified and doubtful, do not rejoice,and reject it, thinking, ’Whence comes
this teaching never before heard?’They then behold other noble sons accepting, becoming vessels
for, and teaching this profound teaching,and they do not attend upon them, do not befriend
them, do not respect them, and do not honor them,and eventually they go so far as
to criticize them.These are the two reasons the beginner bodhisattvas hurt themselves and
do not penetrate the profound Dharma.
