Meanwhile, the area in which the Lord was teaching the Dharma in the garden of Amrapali expanded
and grew larger,and the entire assembly appeared tinged with a golden hue.Thereupon,
the venerable Ānanda asked the Buddha,"Lord, this expansion and enlargement of the garden
of Amrapaliand this golden hue of the assembly - what do these auspicious signs portend?"

The Buddha declared,"Ānanda, these auspicious signs portend that the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and
the crown prince Mañjuśrī, attended by a great multitude, are coming into the presence of
the Tathāgata."
