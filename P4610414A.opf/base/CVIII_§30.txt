The bodhisattva Maṇikūṭarāja declared,"It is dualistic to speak of good paths and bad paths.One
who is on the path is not concerned with good or bad paths.Living in such unconcern, he
entertains no concepts of ’path’ or ’nonpath.’Understanding the nature of concepts, his
mind does not engage in duality. Such is the entrance into nonduality."
