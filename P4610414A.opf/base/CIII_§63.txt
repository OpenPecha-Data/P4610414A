"No sooner had I said these words thanthe Licchavi Vimalakīrti came there and said to me,’Noble
son, do not think that this is Indra!(This is not Indra) but the evil Māra, who has come
to ridicule you.’This is not Indra (but the evil Māra, who has come to ridicule you.’ )

"Then the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to Māra,’Evil Māra, since these heavenly maidens are not
suitable for this religious devotee, a son of the Sakya, give them to me.’

"Then Māra was terrified and distressed,thinking that the Licchavi Vimalakīrti had come to expose
him.He tried to make himself invisible, but, try as he might with all his magical powers,
he could not vanish from sight.Then a voice resounded in the sky, saying,’Evil One,
give these heavenly maidens to the good man Vimalakīrti, and only then will you be able to
return to your own abode.’"Then Māra was even more frightened and, much against his will,
gave the heavenly maidens.
