of the liberations, and of the knowledge and vision of liberation.It is born of love,
compassion, joy, and impartiality.It is born of charity, discipline, and self-control.It
is born of the path of ten virtuesIt is born of patience and gentleness.It is born of the
roots of virtue planted by solid efforts.It is born of the concentrations, the liberations,
the meditations, and the absorptions.It is born of learning, wisdom, and liberative technique.It
is born of the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment.It is born of mental quiescence
and transcendental analysis.It is born of the ten powers, the four fearlessnesses, and the
eighteen special qualities.It is born of all the transcendences.It is born from sciences
and superknowledges.It is born of the abandonment of all evil qualities, and of the collection
of all good qualities.It is born of truth. It is born of reality. It is born of conscious
