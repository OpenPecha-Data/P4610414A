It is the seat of all living beings, because all living beings are without intrinsic identity.It
is the seat of all things, because it is perfectly enlightened with regard to voidness."’It
is the seat of the conquest of all devils, because it never flinches.It is the seat
of the triple world, because it is free of involvement.It is the seat of the heroism that
sounds the lion’s roar, because it is free of fear and trembling.It is the seat of the strengths,
the fearlessnesses, and all the special qualities of the Buddha, because it is irreproachable
in all respects.It is the seat of the three knowledges, because in it no passions
remain.It is the seat of instantaneous, total understanding of all things, because it
realizes fully the gnosis of omniscience.
