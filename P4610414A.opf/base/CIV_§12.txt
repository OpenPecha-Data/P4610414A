Furthermore, he should understand thoroughly the conception of himself as a thing by cultivating
the following consideration:’Just as in the case of the conception of "self," so the
conception of "thing" is also a misunderstanding,and this misunderstanding is also a grave
sickness;I should free myself from this sicknessand should strive to abandon it.’"What is
the elimination of this sickness?It is the elimination of egoism and possessiveness.What
is the elimination of egoism and possessiveness?It is the freedom from dualism.What is freedom
from dualism?It is the absence of involvement with either the external or the internal.What
is absence of involvement with either external or internal?It is nondeviation, nonfluctuation,
and nondistraction from equanimity.What is equanimity?It is the equality of everything
from self to liberation.Why?Because both self and liberation are void.How can both
be void?As verbal designations, they both are void,and neither is established in reality.Therefore,
one who sees such equality makes no difference between sickness and voidness;
his sickness is itself voidness,and that sickness as voidness is itself void.
