Then the Buddha said to the venerable Ānanda,"Receive then, Ānanda, this expression of the teaching
of the Dharma. Remember it, and teach it widely and correctly to others!"

Ānanda replied, "I have memorized, Lord, this expression of the teaching of the Dharma.But what
is the name of this teaching,and how should I remember it?"

The Buddha said,"Ānanda, this exposition of the Dharma is called ’The Teaching of Vimalakīrti,’
or ’The Reconciliation of Dichotomies,’ or even ’Section of the Inconceivable Liberation.’Remember
it thus!"

Thus spoke the Buddha. And the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, the crown prince Mañjuśrī, the venerable
Ānanda, the bodhisattvas, the great disciples, the entire multitude, and the whole universe
with its gods, men, asuras and gandharvas, rejoiced exceedingly. All heartily praised
these declarations by the Lord.
