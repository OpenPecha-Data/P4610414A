Then, the patriarch Mahākāśyapa, having heard this teaching of the inconceivable liberation
of the bodhisattvas, was amazed, and he said to the venerable Śāriputra,"Venerable Śāriputra,
if one were to show a variety of things to a person blind from birth, he would not be
able to see a single thing.Likewise, venerable Śāriputra, when this door of the inconceivable
liberation is taught, all the disciples and solitary sages are sightless, like the man
blind from birth, and cannot comprehend even a single cause of the inconceivable liberation.Who
is there among the wise who, hearing about this inconceivable liberation, does not
conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment?As for us, whose faculties are deteriorated,
like a burned and rotten seed, what else can we do if we do not become receptive
to this great vehicle?We, all the disciples and solitary sages, upon hearing this teaching
of the Dharma,should utter a cry of regret that would shake this billion-world-galactic
universe!And as for the bodhisattvas, when they hear of this inconceivable liberation they
should be as joyful as a young crown prince when he takes the diadem and is anointed, and
they should increase to the utmost their devotion to this inconceivable liberation.Indeed,
what could the entire host of Māras ever do to one who is devoted to this inconceivable
liberation?"When the patriarch Mahākāśyapa had uttered this discourse, thirty-two thousand
gods conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.
