Then, the elder Mahākāśyapa applauded the crown prince Mañjuśrī:"Good! Good Mañjuśrī! This is
indeed well spoken! This is right!The passions do indeed constitute the family of the Tathāgatas.How
can such as we, the disciples, conceive the spirit of enlightenment, or become
fully enlightened in regard to the qualities of the Buddha?Only those guilty of the five
deadly sins can conceive the spirit of enlightenmentand can attain Buddhahood, which is the
full accomplishment of the qualities of the Buddha!
