Reverend Subhūti, take this food if you understand the equality of all things, by means of the
equality of material objects, and if you understand the equality of all the attributes
of the Buddha, by means of the equality of all things.Take this food if, without abandoning
desire, hatred, and folly, you can avoid association with them;if you can follow the path
of the single way without ever disturbing the egoistic views;if you can produce the knowledges
and liberations without conquering ignorance and the craving for existence;if, by the
equality of the five deadly sins, you reach the equality of liberation;if you are neither
liberated nor bound;if you do not see the Four Holy Truths, yet are not the one who has
not seen the truth;if you have not attained any fruit, yet are not the one who has not attained;if
you are an ordinary person, yet have not the qualities of an ordinary person;if
you are not holy, yet are not unholy; if you are responsible for all things, yet are free
of any notion concerning anything;Take this food, reverend Subhūti
