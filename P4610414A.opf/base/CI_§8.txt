As soon as these precious parasols had been set down suddenly by the power of the Buddha, they
joined together into one single precious parasoland that one single precious parasol covered
all that trichiliomegachiliocosm. The surface of the trichiliomegachiliocosm appeared
on the inside itself of that great precious parasol.Thus there could be seen on the inside
of that great precious parasol all that the trichiliomegachiliocosm contained: Sumeru the
king of mountains, Himadri, Mucilinda, Maḥamucilinda, Gandhamādana, Ratnaparvata, Kālaparvata,
Cakravāḍa and Mahācakravāḍa;the great oceans, tsater-courses, lakes, ponds, rivers,
streams and springs;then, in infinite quantities, the suns, moons and stars, the dwellings
of the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas, as well
as the dwellings of the caturmahārājas;finally, the villages, towns, boroughs, provinces,
kingdoms, capitals and all the surrounding territories.And the instruction in the Law expounded
in the world of ten regions by the Blessed Lord Buddhas could be heard in its entirety,
as if their voices came from that one single great precious parasol.
