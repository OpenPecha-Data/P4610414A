Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti set himself in such a concentration and performed such a miraculous
feat(that those bodhisattvas and those great disciples were enabled to see the universe
called Sarvagandhasugandha, )which is located in the direction of the zenith, beyond
as many buddha-fields as there are sands in forty-two Ganges rivers.that those bodhisattvas
and those great disciples were enabled to see the universe called Sarvagandhasugandha, (which
is located in the direction of the zenith, beyond as many buddha-fields as there are
sands in forty-two Ganges rivers. )There the Tathāgata named Sugandhakūṭa resides, lives,
and is manifest.In that universe, (the trees emit a fragrance that far surpasses all the
fragrances,) human and divine, of all the buddha-fields of the ten directions.In that universe,
the trees emit a fragrance that far surpasses all the fragrances, (human and divine,
of all the buddha-fields of the ten directions. )In that universe, even the names "disciple"
and "solitary sage" do not exist,and the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa teaches the Dharma to
a gathering of bodhisattvas only.In that universe, all the houses, the avenues, the parks,
and the palaces are made of various perfumes,and the fragrance of the food eaten by those
bodhisattvas pervades immeasurable universes.

At this time, the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa sat down with his bodhisattvas to take his meal,and
the deities called Gandhavyūhāhāra, who were all devoted to the Mahāyāna, served and attended
upon the Buddha and his bodhisattvas.Everyone in the gathering at the house of Vimalakīrti
was able to see distinctly this universe wherein the Tathāgata Sugandhakūṭa and his
bodhisattvas were taking their meal.
