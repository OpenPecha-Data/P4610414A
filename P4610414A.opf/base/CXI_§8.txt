The Lord then said to the venerable Śāriputra,"Śāriputra, did you see that universe Abhirati,
and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya?"

Śāriputra replied, "I saw it, Lord!May all living beings come to live in a buddha-field as splendid
as that!May all living beings come to have miraculous powers just like those of the
noble Licchavi Vimalakīrti!"We have gained great benefit from having seen a holy man such
as he.We have gained a great benefit from having heard such teaching of the Dharma, whether
the Tathāgata himself still actually exists or whether he has already attained ultimate
liberation.Hence, there is no need to mention the great benefit for those who, having heard
it, believe it, rely on it, embrace it, remember it, read it, and penetrate to its depth;
and, having found faith in it, teach, recite, and show it to others and apply themselves
to the yoga of meditation upon its teaching. "
