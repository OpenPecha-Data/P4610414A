The Licchavi Vimalakīrti created ninety million lion-thrones exactly like those already there,and
the bodhisattvas were seated.Then, the incarnation-bodhisattva gave the vessel full
of food to Vimalakīrti,and the fragrance of that food permeated the entire great city of Vaiśālīand
its sweet perfume spread throughout one hundred universes.Within the city of Vaiśālī,
the brahmans, householders, and even the Licchavi chieftain Candracchattra, having noticed
this fragrance, were amazed and filled with wonder.They were so cleansed in body and
mind that they came at once to the house of Vimalakīrti, along with all eighty-four thousand
of the Licchavis.Seeing there the bodhisattvas seated on the high, wide, and beautiful
lion-thrones, they were filled with admiration and great joy. They all bowed down to those
great disciples and bodhisattvas and then sat down to one side.And the gods of the earth,
the gods of the desire-world, and the gods of the material world, attracted by the perfume,
also came to the house of Vimalakīrti.
