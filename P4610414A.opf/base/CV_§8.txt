Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the young prince Mañjuśrī,"Mañjuśrī, let the bodhisattvas
be seated on these thrones, having transformed their bodies to a suitable size!"

Then, those bodhisattvas who had attained the superknowledges transformed their bodies to a
height of forty-two hundred thousand leagues and sat upon the thrones.But the beginner bodhisattvas
were not able to transform themselves to sit upon the thrones.Then, the Licchavi
Vimalakīrti taught these beginner bodhisattvas a teaching that enabled them to attain the
five superknowledges, and, having attained them, they transformed their bodies to a height
of forty-two hundred thousand leagues and sat upon the thrones. But still the great disciples
were not able to seat themselves upon the thrones.

The Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to the venerable Śāriputra,"Reverend Śāriputra, take your seat
upon a throne."

He replied, "Good sir, the thrones are too big and too high, and I cannot sit upon them."

Vimalakīrti said, "Reverend Śāriputra, bow down to the Tathāgata Merupradīparāja,and you will
be able to take your seat."

Then, the great disciples bowed down to the Tathāgata Merupradīparājaand they were seated upon
the thrones.
