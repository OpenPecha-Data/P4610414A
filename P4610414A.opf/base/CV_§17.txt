The bodhisattva can transform miraculously all the cries and noises, superior, mediocre, and
inferior, of all living beings of the ten directions, into the voice of the Buddha,with the
words of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, having them proclaim,’Impermanent! Miserable!
Empty! Selfless!’And he can cause them to recite the words and sounds of all the teachings
taught by all the Buddhas of the ten directions.
