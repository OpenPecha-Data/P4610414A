Then the Blessed One said to the venerable Śāriputra: Can you see, Śāriputra, the splendour
of the virtues of my Buddha-field?

Yes, I can see O Blessed One, that splendour that has never been seen or heard before.

The Buddha continued: Śāriputra, my Buddhakṣetra is always as pure as this, but, to help inferior
beings ripen, the Tathāgata makes it appear like a field vitiated with many flaws.For
example, O Śāriputra, the sons of the gods take their food from one single precious receptacle,
but thye ambrosia which is the food of the gods varies according to the diverse merits
accumulated by the gods. Equally Śāriputra, beings born in the same Buddhakṣetra see,
in proportion to their purity, the splendour of the Buddhakṣetra of the Buddhas.
