The bodhisattva Satyarata declared,"It is dualistic to speak of ’true’ and ’false.’When one
sees truly, one does not ever see any truth, so how could one see falsehood?Why?One does not
see with the physical eye, one sees with the eye of wisdom.And with the wisdom-eye one
sees only insofar as there is neither sight nor nonsight.There, where there is neither sight
nor nonsight, is the entrance into nonduality."
