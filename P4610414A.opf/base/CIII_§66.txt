Vimalakīrti replied, ’Sisters, there is a door of the Dharma called "The Inexhaustible Lamp."
Practice it!What is it? Sisters, a single lamp may light hundreds of thousands of lampswithout
itself being diminished.Likewise, sisters, a single bodhisattva may establish many
hundreds of thousands of living beings in enlightenmentwithout his mindfulness being diminished.
In fact, not only does it not diminish, it grows stronger.Likewise, the more you teach
and demonstrate virtuous qualities to others, the more you grow with respect to these
virtuous qualities.This is the door of the Dharma called "The Inexhaustible Lamp."When you
are living in the realm of Māra, inspire innumerable gods and goddesses with the spirit of
enlightenment.In such a way, you will repay the kindness of the Tathāgata,and you will become
the benefactors of all living beings.’
