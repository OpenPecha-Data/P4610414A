Furthermore, reverend Ä€nanda, if monks who have not entered ultimate determination eat this
food, it will be digested when they enter that determination.When those who have entered ultimate
determination eat this food, it will not be digested until their minds are totally
liberated.If living beings who have not conceived the spirit of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment
eat this food, it will be digested when they conceive the spirit of unexcelled, perfect
enlightenment.If those who have conceived the spirit of perfect enlightenment eat this
food, it will not be digested until they have attained tolerance.And if those who have
attained tolerance eat this food, it will be digested when they have become bodhisattvas
one lifetime away from Buddhahood.
