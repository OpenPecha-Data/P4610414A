The bodhisattva Aká¹£ayamati declared,"The dedication of generosity for the sake of attaining
omniscience is dualistic.The nature of generosity is itself omniscience, and the nature of
omniscience itself is total dedication.Likewise, it is dualistic to dedicate morality, tolerance,
effort, meditation, and wisdom for the sake of omniscience.Omniscience is the nature
of wisdom, and total dedication is the nature of omniscience.Thus, the entrance into this
principle of uniqueness is the entrance into nonduality."
