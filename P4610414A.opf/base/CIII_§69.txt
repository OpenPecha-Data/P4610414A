’A Dharma-sacrifice is that which develops living beings without beginning or end, giving gifts
to them all simultaneously.What is that?It consists of the great love which is consummated
in enlightenment;of the great compassion which is consummated in the concentration of
the holy Dharma on the liberation of all living beings;of the great joy which is consummated
in the awareness of the supreme happiness of all living beings;and of the great equanimity
which is consummated in concentration through knowledge. "’
