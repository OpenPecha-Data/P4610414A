At these words, the Buddha said to Śakra, the prince of the gods,"Excellent! Excellent, prince
of gods!The Tathāgata rejoices in your good words.Prince of gods, the enlightenment of
the Buddhas of the past, present, and future is expressed in this discourse of Dharma.Therefore,
prince of gods, when noble sons and daughters accept it, repeat it, understand it deeply,
write it completely, and, making it into a book, honor it, those sons and daughters
thereby pay homage to the Buddhas of the past, present and future.
