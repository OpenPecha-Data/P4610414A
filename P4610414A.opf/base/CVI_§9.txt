Then the venerable Śāriputra said to the goddess,"Goddess, how long have you been in this house?"

The goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has been in liberation."

Śāriputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some time?"

The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some time?"

At that, the elder Śāriputra fell silent.

The goddess continued, "Elder, you are ’foremost of the wise!’ Why do you not speak? Now, when
it is your turn, you do not answer the question."

Śāriputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not know what to say.

Goddess: All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of liberation.Why?Liberation
is neither internal nor external, nor can it be apprehended apart from them.Likewise,
syllables are neither internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere else.Therefore,
reverend Śāriputra, do not point to liberation by abandoning speech!Why?The holy liberation
is the equality of all things!

Śāriputra: Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire, hatred, and folly?

Goddess: "Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly" that is the teaching of the
excessively proud.But those free of pride are taught that the very nature of desire, hatred,
and folly is itself liberation.
