The venerable Śāriputra then asked the Buddha,"Lord, in which buddha-field did the noble Vimalakīrti
die, before reincarnating in this buddha-field?"

The Buddha said,"Śāriputra, ask this good man directly where he died to reincarnate here."

Then the venerable Śāriputra asked the Licchavi Vimalakīrti,"Noble sir, where did you die to
reincarnate here?"

Vimalakīrti declared,"Is there anything among the things that you see, elder, that dies or is
reborn?"

Śāriputra: There is nothing that dies or is reborn.

Vimalakīrti: Likewise, reverend Śāriputra, as all things neither die nor are reborn, why do
you ask, "Where did you die to reincarnate here?"Reverend Śāriputra, if one were to ask a
man or woman created by a magician where he or she had died to reincarnate there, what do
you think he or she would answer?

Śāriputra: Noble sir, a magical creation does not die, nor is it reborn.

Vimalakīrti: Reverend Śāriputra, did not the Tathāgata declare that all things have the nature
of a magical creation?

Śāriputra: Yes, noble sir, that is indeed so.

Vimalakīrti: Reverend Śāriputra, "death" is an end of performance,and "rebirth" is the continuation
of performance.But, although a bodhisattva dies, he does not put an end to the performance
of the roots of virtue,and although he is reborn, he does not adhere to the continuation
of sin.
