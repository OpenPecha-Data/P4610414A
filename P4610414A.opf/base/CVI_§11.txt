Śāriputra: Goddess, do you belong to the disciple-vehicle, to the solitary-vehicle, or to the
great vehicle?

Goddess: I belong to the disciple-vehicle when I teach it to those who need it.I belong to the
solitary-vehicle when I teach the twelve links of dependent origination to those who need
them.And, since I never abandon the great compassion, I belong to the great vehicle, as
all need that teaching to attain ultimate liberation.
