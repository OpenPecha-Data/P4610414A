Sons of good family, the field of beings is the Buddhakṣetra of the Bodhisattvas. And why is
it so?To the extent that Bodhisattvas favour beings do they acquire Buddhakṣetras.To the
extent that beings are disciplined do Bodhisattvas acquire Buddhakṣetras.To the extent that
beings, entering those Buddhakṣetras, penetrate the knowledge of the Buddhas do Bodhisattvas
acquire Buddhakṣetras.To the extent that beings, entering those Buddhakṣetras, produce
noble dominant faculties do Bodhisattvas acquire Buddhakṣetras.And why is it so? Sons of
good family, the Buddhakṣetras of the Bodhisattvas draw their origin from the benefits rendered
by them to beings.For example, O Ratnākara, if one desires to build on something which
resembles space, it can be done; but, in space, nothing can be built, nothing can be adorned.Similarly,
O Ratnākara, knowing that all dharmas are like space and to help beings
ripen, the Bodhisattva who wishes to build something resembling a Buddhakṣetra can build a
simulated Buddhakṣetra, but it is impossible to build a Buddhakṣetra in the void and it is
impossible to adorn it.
