Indeed, the entire gathering was satisfied by that food,and the food was not at all depleted.Having
eaten that food, there arose in the bodies of those bodhisattvas, disciples, Sakras,
Brahmās, Lokapālas, and other living beings,a bliss just like the bliss of the bodhisattvas
of the universe Sarvasukhamandita.And from all the pores of their skin arose a perfumelike
that of the trees that grow in the universe Sarvagandhasugandhā.
