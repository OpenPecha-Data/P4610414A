The bodhisattva Apratihatanetra declared,"It is dualistic to refer to ’aggregates’ and to the
’cessation of aggregates.’Aggregates themselves are cessation.Why?The egoistic views of
aggregates, being unproduced themselves, do not exist ultimately.Hence such views do not really
conceptualize ’These are aggregates’ or ’These aggregates cease.’Ultimately, they have
no such discriminative constructions and no such conceptualizations. Therefore, such views
have themselves the nature of cessation.Nonoccurrence and nondestruction are the entrance
into nonduality."
