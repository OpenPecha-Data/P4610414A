But some of the disciples had already had the thought:"How can such a huge multitude eat such
a small amount of food?"

Then the incarnation-bodhisattva said to those disciples,"Do not compare, venerable ones, your
own wisdom and merits with the wisdom and the merits of the Tathāgata!Why?For example,
the four great oceans might dry up,but this food would never be exhausted.If all living beings
were to eat for an aeon an amount of this food equal to Mount Sumeru in size, it would
not be depleted.Why?Issued from inexhaustible morality, concentration, and wisdom, the remains
of the food of the Tathāgata contained in this vessel cannot be exhausted."
