"’It is the seat of generosity, because it has no expectation of reward.It is the seat of morality,
because it fulfills all commitments.It is the seat of tolerance, because it is free
of anger toward any living being.It is the seat of effort, because it does not turn back.It
is the seat of meditation, because it generates fitness of mind.It is the seat of wisdom,
because it sees everything directly. "’
