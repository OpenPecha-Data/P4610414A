Then, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti saw the crown prince Mañjuśrī and addressed him thus:"Mañjuśrī!
Welcome, Mañjuśrī! You are very welcome! There you are, without any coming. You appear,
without any seeing. You are heard, without any hearing."

Mañjuśrī declared, "Householder, it is as you say.Who comes, finally comes not.Who goes, finally
goes not.Why?Who comes is not known to come.Who goes is not known to go.Who appears is
finally not to be seen.
