Then the crown prince Mañjuśrī said to the Licchavi Vimalakīrti,"We have all given our own teachings,
noble sir. Now, may you elucidate the teaching of the entrance into the principle
of nonduality!"

Thereupon, the Licchavi Vimalakīrti kept his silence, saying nothing at all.

The crown prince Mañjuśrī applauded the Licchavi Vimalakīrti:"Excellent! Excellent, noble sir!
This is indeed the entrance into the nonduality of the bodhisattvas. Here there is no use
for syllables, sounds, and ideas."

When these teachings had been declared, five thousand bodhisattvas entered the door of the Dharma
of nonduality and attained tolerance of the birthlessness of things.
