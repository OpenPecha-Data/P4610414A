Vimalakīrti: Mañjuśrī, with what in mind do you say so?

Mañjuśrī: Noble sir, one who stays in the fixed determination of the vision of the uncreated
is not capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment.However, one
who lives among created things, in the mines of passions, without seeing any truth,is indeed
capable of conceiving the spirit of unexcelled perfect enlightenment.Noble sir, flowers
like the blue lotus, the red lotus, the white lotus, the water lily, and the moon lily do
not grow on the dry ground in the wilderness,but do grow in the swamps and mud banks.Just
so, the Buddha-qualities do not grow in living beings certainly destined for the uncreatedbut
do grow in those living beings who are like swamps and mud banks of passions.Likewise,
as seeds do not grow in the skybut do grow in the earth,so the Buddha-qualities do not grow
in those determined for the absolute(but do grow in those who conceive the spirit of enlightenment),
after having produced a Sumeru-like mountain of egoistic views.but do grow
in those who conceive the spirit of enlightenment, (after having produced a Sumeru-like mountain
of egoistic views. )Noble sir, through these considerations one can understand that
all passions constitute the family of the Tathāgatas.For example, noble sir, without going
out into the great ocean, it is impossible to find precious, priceless pearls.Likewise,
without going into the ocean of passions, it is impossible to obtain the mind of omniscience.
