Lord, when I heard these words of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti, I wondered what I should say and
what I should do, but I was totally in the dark.Leaving the bowl, I was about to leave the
house

when the Licchavi Vimalakīrti said to me, Reverend Subhūti, do not fear these words, and pick
up your bowl.What do you think, reverend Subhūti? If it were an incarnation created by the
Tathāgata who spoke thus to you, would you be afraid?

I answered, No indeed, noble sir!

He then said, Reverend Subhūti, the nature of all things is like illusion, like a magical incarnation.
So you should not fear them. Why?All words also have that nature, and thus the
wise are not attached to words, nor do they fear them. Why?All language does not ultimately
exist, except as liberation. The nature of all things is liberation.
