This body is unreal, being a collocation of the four main elements.

It is void, not existing as self or as self-possessed.

It is inanimate, being like grass, trees, walls, clods of earth, and hallucinations.

It is insensate, being driven like a windmill.

It is filthy, being an agglomeration of pus and excrement.

It is false, being fated to be broken and destroyed, in spite of being anointed and massaged.

It is afflicted by the four hundred and four diseases.

It is like an ancient well, constantly overwhelmed by old age.

Its duration is never certain - certain only is its end in death.

This body is a combination of aggregates, elements, and sense-media, which are comparable to
murderers, poisonous snakes, and an empty town, respectively.

Therefore, you should be revulsed by such a body. You should despair of it and should arouse
your admiration for the body of the Tathāgata.
