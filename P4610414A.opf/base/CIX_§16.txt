The bodhisattvas said,"Thus is established the greatness of the Buddha Śākyamuni! It is marvelous
how, concealing his miraculous power, he civilizes the wild living beings who are poor
and inferior.And the bodhisattvas who settle in a buddha-field of such intense hardships
must have inconceivably great compassion!"The Licchavi Vimalakīrti declared,"So be it, good
sirs! It is as you say.The great compassion of the bodhisattvas who reincarnate here is
extremely firm.In a single lifetime in this universe, they accomplish much benefit for living
beings.So much benefit for living beings could not be accomplished in the universe Sarvagandhasugandhā
even in one hundred thousand aeons.
