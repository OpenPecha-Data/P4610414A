"What is not resting in the uncompounded?The bodhisattva practices voidness, but he does not
realize voidness.He practices signlessness but does not realize signlessness. He practices
wishlessness but does not realize wishlessness. He practices non-performance but does not
realize non-performance.He knows impermanence but is not complacent about his roots of virtue.He
considers misery, but he reincarnates voluntarily.He knows selflessness but does
not waste himself.He considers peacefulness but does not seek extreme peace.He cherishes solitude
but does not avoid mental and physical efforts.He considers placelessness but does
not abandon the place of good actions.He considers occurrencelessness but undertakes to bear
the burdens of all living beings.He considers immaculateness, yet he follows the process
of the world.He considers motionlessness, yet he moves in order to develop all living beings.He
considers selflessness yet does not abandon the great compassion toward all living
beings.He considers birthlessness, yet he does not fall into the ultimate determination
of the disciples.He considers vanity, futility, insubstantiality, dependency, and placelessness,
yet he establishes himself on merits that are not vain, on knowledge that is not futile,
on reflections that are substantial, on the striving for the consecration of the independent
gnosis, and on the Buddha-family in its definitive meaning."Thus, noble sons, a bodhisattva
who aspires to such a Dharma neither rests in the uncompounded nor destroys the
compounded. "
