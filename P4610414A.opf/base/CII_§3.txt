He wore the white clothes of the layman, yet lived impeccably like a religious devotee.He lived
at home, but remained aloof from the realm of desire, the realm of pure matter, and the
immaterial realm.He had a son, a wife, and female attendants, yet always maintained continence.He
appeared to be surrounded by servants, yet lived in solitude.He appeared to be adorned
with ornaments, yet always was endowed with the auspicious signs and marks.He seemed
to eat and drink, yet always took nourishment from the taste of meditation.He made his appearance
at the fields of sports and in the casinos, but his aim was always to mature those
people who were attached to games and gambling.He visited the fashionable heterodox teachers,
yet always kept unswerving loyalty to the Buddha.He understood the mundane and transcendental
sciences and esoteric practices, yet always took pleasure in the delights of the
Dharma.He mixed in all crowds, yet was respected as foremost of all.
