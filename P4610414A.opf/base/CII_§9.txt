This body is like a ball of foam, unable to bear any pressure.

It is like a water bubble, not remaining very long.

It is like a mirage, born from the appetites of the passions.

It is like the trunk of the plantain tree, having no core.

Alas! This body is like a machine, a nexus of bones and tendons.

It is like a magical illusion, consisting of falsifications.

It is like a dream, being an unreal vision.

It is like a reflection, being the image of former actions.

It is like an echo, being dependent on conditioning.

It is like a cloud, being characterized by turbulence and dissolution.

It is like a flash of lightning, being unstable, and decaying every moment.

The body is ownerless, being the product of a variety of conditions.
